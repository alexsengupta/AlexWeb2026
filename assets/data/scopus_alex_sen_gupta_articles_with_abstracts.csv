However, whether similar responses occurred in other La Niña events remains unclear. Here we investigate analogous impacts during other El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events using available sea level height observations during 1993–2022. We find that ENSO consistently drives changes in terrestrial and oceanic precipitation, land water storage, and sea surface salinity. These changes cause temporary global sea level declines during La Niña and increases during El Niño, with the most pronounced variations occurring during the build-up phase of ENSO. A strong negative relationship between terrestrial precipitation and global mean sea level underscores the critical role of ENSO-driven global water redistribution. Northern South America consistently experienced water storage gains during La Niña and declines during El Niño, whereas water storage changes in Australia were inconsistent."

During 2023, an extreme and near-basin-scale marine heatwave developed during Northern Hemisphere summer, peaking in July. The warming spread across virtually all regions of the North Atlantic, including the subpolar ocean, where a cooling trend over the past 50–100 years has been linked to a slowdown in the meridional overturning circulation10,11. Yet the mechanisms that led to this exceptional surface ocean warming remain unclear. Here we use observationally constrained atmospheric reanalyses alongside ocean observations and model simulations to show that air–sea heat fluxes acting on an extremely shallow surface mixed layer, rather than anomalous ocean heat transport, were responsible for this extreme ocean warming event. The dominant driver is shown to be anomalously weak winds leading to strongly shoaling (shallowing) mixed layers, resulting in a rapid temperature increase in a shallow surface layer of the North Atlantic. Furthermore, solar radiation anomalies made regional-scale warming contributions in locations that approximately correspond to some of the region’s main shipping lanes, suggesting that reduced sulfate emissions could also have played a localized role. With a trend towards shallower mixed layers observed over recent decades, and projections that this will continue into the future, the severity of North Atlantic marine heatwaves is set to worsen."

To aid decision making in a rapidly warming ocean, researchers have developed new forecast tools that can predict marine heatwaves on sub-seasonal to seasonal timescales. As demand from marine stakeholders increases for actionable information, effective transfer is paramount for uptake and response. Here we consider three aspects critical to aid this information transfer. The model system must be useful – having the appropriate model type, resolution, and domain, with model skill verified against observations. The forecasts must be useable with skill on timescales relevant to decision making, interpretable by end users, and delivered in a practical format. The forecast information must be used, which requires clear communication at appropriate levels, strong user engagement, and consideration of industry agility and incentives. Feedback between these three aspects is needed to ensure continuous improvement in the level of forecast usefulness, useability, and uptake. Forecasts are a critical tool in the management of climate risk and the framework we present here will be important for maintaining profitable and sustainable marine industries into the future."

However, there is ongoing debate regarding the definition of these extreme events, which is crucial for effective research and communication among marine scientists, decision-makers, and the broader public. Fundamental to all MHW analyses is a clearly defined background oceanic climate – i.e., a temperature ‘baseline’ against which the MHW is defined. While a single approach to implementing a baseline may not be suitable for all MHW research applications, the choice of a baseline for analysing MHWs must be intentional as it affects research outcomes. This perspective examines baseline choices and discusses their implications for marine organism and ecosystem risks, and their relevance in communicating MHW characteristics and metrics to stakeholders, policymakers, and the public. In particular we analyse five different baseline approaches for computing MHW statistics, assess their technical differences, and discuss their ecological implications. Different baselines suggest widely different trends in MHW characteristics in a warming world. This would, for example, imply differences in future risk, reflective of marine organisms with different adaptive potential, thereby affecting recommendations for management strategies. We also examine the consequences of different baseline choices on ease of implementation and communication with wider audiences. Our analyses highlight the need to clearly specify a chosen baseline in MHW studies, and to be mindful of its implications for MHW statistics, practical considerations, and interpretations concerning the adaptive capacities of marine organisms, ecosystems and human systems. The challenges and implications of different MHW baselines highlighted here have similar relevance in research and communication for other branches of climate extremes."

These events can cause extensive damage to coastal areas if occurring close to landfall. Available models struggle to provide accurate RI estimates due to the complexity of underlying physical mechanisms. This study provides new insights into the prediction of a subset of rapidly intensifying TCs influenced by prolonged ocean warming events known as marine heatwaves (MHWs). MHWs could provide sufficient energy to supercharge TCs. Preconditioning by MHW led to RI of recent destructive TCs, Otis (2023), Doksuri (2023), and Ian (2022), with economic losses exceeding $150 billion. Here, we analyze the TC best track and sea surface temperature data from 1981 to 2023 to identify hotspot regions for compound events, where MHWs and RI of tropical cyclones occur concurrently or in succession. Building upon this, we propose an ensemble machine learning model for RI forecasting based on storm and MHW characteristics. This approach is particularly valuable as RI forecast errors are typically largest in favorable environments, such as those created by MHWs. Our study offers insight into predicting MHW TCs, which have been shown to be stronger TCs with potentially higher destructive power. Here, we show that using MHW predictors instead of the conventional method of using sea surface temperature reduces the false alarm rate by 30%. Overall, our findings contribute to coastal hazard risk awareness amidst unprecedented climate warming causing more frequent MHWs."

Here, we use machine learning together with more traditional approaches to quantify how much precipitation variability can be explained by large-scale modes of variability, and to understand the degree to which these modes interact non-linearly. We find that the relationship between climate modes and precipitation is predominantly non-linear. In some regions and seasons climate modes can explain up to 80% of precipitation variability. However, variability explained is below 10% for more than half of the land surface, and only 1% of the land shows values above 50%. This outcome provides a clear rationale to limit expectations of predictability from modes of variability in all but a few select regions and seasons."

Here, we critically review the recent substantial advances in this active area of research, including the exploration of the three-dimensional structure and evolution of these extremes, their drivers, their connection with other extremes in the ocean and over land, future projections, and assessment of their predictability and current prediction skill. To make progress on predicting and projecting marine heatwaves and their impacts, a more complete mechanistic understanding of these extremes over the full ocean depth and at the relevant spatial and temporal scales is needed, together with models that can realistically capture the leading mechanisms at those scales. Sustained observing systems, as well as measuring platforms that can be rapidly deployed, are essential to achieve comprehensive event characterizations while also chronicling the evolving nature of these extremes and their impacts in our changing climate."

To better understand their impacts, we examine responses of critical, habitat-forming foundation species (macroalgae, seagrass, corals) to marine heatwaves in 1322 shallow coastal areas located across 85 marine ecoregions. We find compelling evidence that intense, summer marine heatwaves play a significant role in the decline of foundation species globally. Critically, detrimental effects increase towards species warm-range edges and over time. We also identify several ecoregions where foundation species don’t respond to marine heatwaves, suggestive of some resilience to warming events. Cumulative marine heatwave intensity, absolute temperature, and location within a species’ range are key factors mediating impacts. Our results suggest many coastal ecosystems are losing foundation species, potentially impacting associated biodiversity, ecological function, and ecosystem services provision. Understanding relationships between marine heatwaves and foundation species offers the potential to predict impacts that are critical for developing management and adaptation approaches."

Some of the major concerns associated with this widespread fishing device are potential entanglement of sea turtles and other marine fauna in dFAD netting; marine debris and pollution; and potential ecological damage via stranding on coral reefs, beaches, and other essential habitats for marine fauna. To assess and quantify the potential connectivity (number of dFADs deployed in an area and arriving in another area) between dFAD deployment areas and important oceanic or coastal habitat of critically endangered leatherback (Dermochelys coriacea) and hawksbill (Eretmochelys imbricata) sea turtles in the Pacific Ocean, we conducted passive-drift Lagrangian experiments with simulated dFAD drift profiles and compared them with known important sea turtle areas. Up to 60% of dFADs from equatorial areas were arriving in essential sea turtle habitats. Connectivity was less when only areas where dFADs are currently deployed were used. Our simulations identified potential regions of dFAD interactions with migration and feeding habitats of the east Pacific leatherback turtle in the tropical southeastern Pacific Ocean; coastal habitats of leatherback and hawksbill in the western Pacific (e.g., archipelagic zones of Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, and Solomon Islands); and foraging habitat of leatherback in a large equatorial area south of Hawaii. Additional research is needed to estimate entanglements of sea turtles with dFADs at sea and to quantify the likely changes in connectivity and distribution of dFADs under new management measures, such as use of alternative nonentangling dFAD designs that biodegrade, or changes in deployment strategies, such as shifting locations."
2-s2.0-85184991589,Combined Impacts of Southern Annular Mode and Zonal Wave 3 on Antarctic Sea Ice Variability,Journal of Climate,2024-03-10,37,5,1759-1775,10.1175/JCLI-D-23-0516.1,ar,Article,6,,0,"Large-scale modes of atmospheric variability in the southern midlatitudes can influence Antarctic sea ice concentrations (SIC) via diverse processes. For instance, variability in both the Southern Annular Mode (SAM) and zonal wave 3 (ZW3) have been linked to the abrupt 2015/16 sea ice decline. While SIC responses to each of SAM and ZW3 have been examined previously, their interaction and synchronous impact on Antarctic sea ice has not. Here, we investigate SAM/ZW3 interactions and their associated combined impacts on Antarctic sea ice using a 1200-yr simulation from a state-of-the-art climate model. Our results suggest that zonal wind anomalies associated with SAM drive SIC anomalies in the marginal ice-zone via advection of ice normal to the ice edge and Ekman drift. In contrast, meridional wind anomalies associated with ZW3 can have opposing dynamic and thermodynamic effects on SIC. Both SAM- and ZW3-related SIC anomalies propagate eastward, likely by the Antarctic Circumpolar Current. The interaction of SAM and ZW3 leads to interesting regional SIC responses. During negative SAM, ZW3-associated meridional wind anomalies across western Antarctica are closer to the ice edge and have a stronger impact on sea ice overall. ZW3 phase affects meridional wind anomalies across the whole ice edge, whereas it affects SIC anomalies mainly over western Antarctica. In parts of eastern Antarctica, SIC anomalies are less sensitive to ZW3 phase, but are sensitive to SAM, particularly in locations where the ice edge has a prominent angle relative to the SAM-related zonal wind anomalies. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: The Southern Annular Mode (SAM) and zonal wave 3 (ZW3) are large-scale atmospheric circulation patterns affecting midlatitude east–west and north–south winds, respectively, over the Southern Ocean. Variations in winds can affect sea ice formation, which can feed back to influence Southern Hemisphere climate. We examine how variations in SAM and ZW3 affect Antarctic sea ice due to a combination of wind- and ocean-driven ice movement and sea ice growth or melting. Regional variations in ice concentrations are due both to alternating north–south ZW3 winds and to the interaction of SAM-related east–west winds with the ice edge. SAM and ZW3 can also interact, leading to stronger north–south wind and sea ice responses over western Antarctica when SAM-related midlatitude winds weaken."

Here, we analyze the surface layer heat budget of the Indian Ocean to diagnose the processes leading to biases in climatological SST biases in 20 Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) models, in comparison to a suite of observational and reanalysis products. In the western tropical Indian Ocean, we find that weaker than observed winds reduce the strength of surface currents leading to warm SST bias. In the south-eastern tropical Indian Ocean, overly strong southeasterly winds are associated with overestimated coastal upwelling that increases cooling across CMIP6 models. In the Arabian Sea, overly strong surface winds increase latent heat loss and leads to cool SST biases. We also analyze other regions like the Bay of Bengal, where a persistent cool bias cannot be explained by seasonal heat budgets, and southern Indian Ocean, where overly strong surface winds are responsible for cool SST biases. These biases in surface processes are supported by intermodel relationships between relevant variables, thus explaining differences in simulating the climatological SSTs across the model ensemble. Our analysis suggests that biases in atmospheric processes in particular surface winds are a primary cause of biases in Indian Ocean SST. Reducing these biases would improve the simulation of climate variability in the Indian Ocean toward more reliable climate projections and predictions."

However, biases in these estimates can occur due to the heterogeneity in processes influencing recapture data or the experimental design. We outline an approach to quantify and identify ways to reduce this bias through both experimental design and data analysis, using individual based modelling (IBMs). By using an IBM that includes key sources of heterogeneity that are believed to exist in the system, the release and recapture of marked individuals can be simulated under differing experimental, behavioural or landscape scenarios. Using this IBM as a data-generator, we compare a simulated population of individuals with a subset of that population that represent those marked and recaptured in a CMR experiment. Parameter estimates from the data generated by the marked subset are then compared to ‘true’, realised parameters from the wider, unmarked population. We demonstrate this with an application of ‘simulated tagging’ of Pacific skipjack tuna (Katsuwonus pelamis), using scenarios of different release locations of marked individuals, alternative band-recovery models, and differing assumptions that define the spatial extent of the unmarked population. We quantify the error in the estimated survival and fishing mortality parameters and examine how these can be reduced by following differing release and analysis strategies. We show that spatiotemporal heterogeneity of individual dispersion and recovery effort (i.e. fishing pressure) led to severe bias in recapture probability estimates, up to 361%, regardless of experimental design. However, when the baseline of the unmarked population of which marked animals were assumed to be representative was defined by spatial coverage of recaptures, rather than a fixed, spatial management area, bias was reduced to 25%. Our results show that the use of IBM frameworks exploring alternative hypotheses, either in the design of or post-hoc analyses of CMR experiments, support maximising the information that can be derived and quantify the degree of potential bias due to analysis model mis-specification. Furthermore, these methods can benefit other sampling and monitoring programmes in systems with high levels of spatial or ecological heterogeneity."

MHWs and TCs are both modulated by Indo-Pacific climate variability, in particular, the El Niño-Southern Oscillation and the Indian Ocean Dipole. Anthropogenic warming has resulted in more frequent MHWs over the past two decades, a tendency very likely to increase further. Because of their stochastic nature, it is difficult to confidently attribute the declines in TC numbers, observed over large parts of the Indian Ocean except for the Arabian Sea, to climate change. Future projections consistently suggest fewer TCs in the southern Indian Ocean but also more intense TCs with more extreme precipitation at the basin scale. Subduction of the Indian and Australian plates underneath the Eurasian plate creates hotspots for earthquakes in the Indian Ocean that generate tsunamis, devastating bordering countries. Monitoring, predictions, and early warning systems are crucial to mitigate the impacts of marine extremes."

The extent of the ecological damage depends not only on the easily observed surface signature but on the marine heatwave structure at depth. However, due to a paucity of in situ sub-surface observations the vertical structure of marine heatwaves is poorly understood. Here we analyse the sub-surface coherence and controls of marine heatwaves using one of the world’s longest (28 years) records of daily sub-surface ocean temperature off Sydney, Australia. We show that seasonal stratification, large-scale circulation and local downwelling processes control the vertical coherence of coastal marine heatwaves. We define three classes of marine heatwaves which can extend through the water column, form in the shallow surface layer, or sub-surface independently, and are therefore not always evident in surface data. We conclude that sub-surface data need to be considered in monitoring marine heatwaves in coastal areas where maximum biological damage is reported."

However, general circulation models consistently underestimate high-latitude temperatures indicated by proxy records, suggesting that they may miss important processes. Previous studies hypothesized that wintertime polar stratospheric clouds may have played an important role in Arctic warming through greenhouse forcing, but these studies did not consider the effects of atmospheric chemistry or the early Eocene topography. Here we examine these factors using a high-top atmospheric model with interactive chemistry. The lower orography in the low- to mid-latitude Northern Hemisphere early Eocene weakens the stratospheric circulation which, in combination with sufficiently high methane concentrations, leads to a substantial increase in polar stratospheric clouds in the Arctic winter. Furthermore, an increase in early Eocene polar stratospheric clouds due to a 16- to 64-fold higher than pre-industrial methane concentration results in a radiative forcing larger than the direct greenhouse effect from the methane itself. This polar stratospheric cloud-induced radiative forcing could cause up to 7.4 K of Arctic surface warming. These results point to the potential for nonlinear interactions between individual forcings."

Here we estimate global MHWs from the surface to 2,000 m depth, covering the period 1993–2019, and explore biodiversity exposure to their effects. We find that MHWs are typically more intense in the subsurface at 50–200 m and their duration increases up to twofold with depth, although with large spatial variability linked to different oceanographic conditions. Cumulative intensity (a thermal stress proxy) was highest in the upper 250 m, exposing subsurface biodiversity to MHW effects. This can be particularly concerning for up to 22% of the ocean, where high cumulative intensity overlapped the warm range edge of species distributions, thus being more sensitive to thermal stress. Subsurface MHWs can hence drive biodiversity patterns, with consequent effects on ecological interactions and ecosystem processes."

When compared to a reef site with predominantly oceanic inputs, we found that both the lagoon and a small reef adjacent to a catchment have signatures of human-derived DIN shown through depleted δ15N signatures in macroalgae. We find pollution exposure of reef sites is associated with known and unknown sources, rainfall and mixing of water with the open ocean.

Previous studies suggest that a large increase in wintertime Arctic polar stratospheric clouds (PSCs) might have promoted Arctic amplification through additional greenhouse warming. High methane concentrations in warm climates might have increased stratospheric water vapor providing favorable conditions for PSCs. However, methane concentrations in past warm climates are extremely uncertain. Here, we revisit the PSC hypothesis by exploring PSC changes under very high methane levels, 43 preindustrial carbon dioxide, and strong polar-amplified surface warming, using a whole-atmosphere model with fully interactive chemistry. We find that with polar-amplified warming there is a large increase in Arctic outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) that reduces as the methane concentration is increased. PSCs increase monotonically with methane concentration. A large radiative cooling and an increase in water vapor in the stratosphere increases Arctic PSCs, which follow a power law with respect to relative humidity. Using a two-way partial radiative perturbation technique, we show that the OLR reduction due to PSCs is similar to the direct radiative forcing of methane for high methane levels. Thus, we find that PSCs could play an important role in Arctic warming in a warmer-than-present-day climate, but only if methane levels were higher than suggested by previous modeling studies for past warm climates."

We review and synthesize current understanding of MHW impacts at the individual, population, and community levels. We then examine how these impacts affect broader ecosystem services and discuss the current state of research on biological impacts of MHWs. Finally, we explore current and emergent approaches to predicting the occurrence andimpacts of future events, along with adaptation and management approaches. With further increases in intensity and frequency projected for coming decades, MHWs are emerging as pervasive stressors to marine ecosystems globally. A deeper mechanistic understanding of their biological impacts is needed to better predict and adapt to increased MHW activity in the Anthropocene."

This leaves some researchers unclear as to whether findings from Australia apply to systems elsewhere (or vice-versa), which has consequences for the development of ecological theory and the application of ecological management principles. We analyzed 594,612 observations spanning 85 variables describing global climate, soil, geochemistry, plants, animals, and ecosystem function to test if Australia is broadly different to the other continents and compare how different each continent is from the global mean. We found significant differences between Australian and global means for none of 15 climate variables, only seven of 25 geochemistry variables, three of 16 soil variables, five of 12 plant trait variables, four of 11 animal variables, and one of five ecosystem function variables. Seven of these differences remained significant when we adjusted for multiple hypothesis testing: high soil pH, high soil concentrations of sodium and strontium, a high proportion of nitrogen-fixing plants, low plant leaf nitrogen concentration, low annual production rate to birth in mammals, and low marine productivity. Our analyses reveal numerous similarities between Australia and Africa and highlight dissimilarities between continents in the northern vs. southern hemispheres. Australia ranked the most distinctive continent for 26 variables, more often than Europe (15 variables), Africa (13 variables), Asia (12 variables each), South America (11 variables) or North America (8 variables). Australia was distinctive in a range of soil conditions and plant traits, and a few bird and mammal traits, tending to sit at a more extreme end of variation for some variables related to resource availability. However, combined analyses revealed that, overall, Australia is not significantly more different to the global mean than Africa, South America, or Europe. In conclusion, while Australia does have some unique and distinctive features, this is also true for each of the other continents, and the data do not support the idea that Australia is an overall outlier in its biotic or abiotic characteristics."

Here we investigate ENSO variability in the warmer climate of the mid-Pliocene (~3.0–3.3 Ma), when surface temperatures were ~2–3 °C above modern values, in a large ensemble of climate models—the Pliocene Model Intercomparison Project. We show that the ensemble consistently suggests a weakening of ENSO variability, with a mean reduction of 25% (±16%). We further show that shifts in the equatorial Pacific mean state cannot fully explain these changes. Instead, ENSO was suppressed by a series of off-equatorial processes triggered by a northward displacement of the Pacific intertropical convergence zone: weakened convective feedback and intensified Southern Hemisphere circulation, which inhibit various processes that initiate ENSO. The connection between the climatological intertropical convergence zone position and ENSO we find in the past is expected to operate in our warming world with important ramifications for ENSO variability."

As an intricate part of the global climate system, EUC dynamics are essential to understanding future climate change but are poorly represented in global coupled climate models. This study examines EUC representation and future changes in the latest generations of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6 and CMIP5) and an eddy-permitting ocean model. We also examine historical and projected changes in EUC source waters, including the Mindanao Current (MC), New Guinea Coastal Undercurrent (NGCU), and interior thermocline convergence. The circulation features in the models are broadly consistent with observations and ocean reanalyses, but improvements from CMIP5 to CMIP6 are limited. In the future projections, the EUC is enhanced in the western Pacific, with less prominent changes in CMIP6, but more so in the eddy-permitting model. The western Pacific EUC enhancement is likely associated with a wind-driven redirection of waters south of the equator, in which the NGCU boundary flow increases while the interior thermocline convergence decreases. This is superimposed on an overall weakening of the North Pacific subtropical overturning cell, including the MC, interior thermocline convergence, and Ekman divergence. As EUC heat and nutrient composition is linked to its sources, these projected changes have implications for the EUC's role in air–sea feedbacks, nutrient replenishment, and oxygen minimum zone ventilation in the eastern Pacific."

Attempts have been made in the past to define an index that quantifies the variability in the ZW3 pattern; however, existing methods are based on fixed geographical locations and fail to capture certain ZW3 events because of strong variability in phase. In addition, a fixed spatial index poorly characterizes ZW3 in CMIP models, which can exhibit biases in the mean phase of the ZW3 pattern. In this study, we introduce a new way to characterize ZW3 variability by incorporating two indices, one each for magnitude and phase, based on the combination of the first two empirical orthogonal functions (EOFs) of the 500-hPa meridional wind anomalies. We show that the new ZW3 index provides a clear advantage over past indices because it captures a substantially higher proportion of variance (∼40% compared to ∼16%), and it can be used for both reanalysis datasets and coupled climate models regardless of model biases. A composite analysis associated with the new index reveals a strong relationship between the ZW3 defined by our index and sea ice fraction around Antarctica, with significant regional sea ice anomalies during strong ZW3 events with different phases."

The need to forecast these extremes and expected future increases in their intensity and frequency motivates a need to better understand the physical processes that connect climate modes to regional precipitation. Focusing on east Australia, where precipitation is driven by multiple interacting climate modes, this study provides a new perspective into the links between large-scale modes of climate variability and precipitation. Using a Lagrangian back-trajectory approach, we examine how El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) modifies the supply of evaporative moisture for precipitation, and how this is modulated by the Indian Ocean dipole (IOD) and southern annular mode (SAM). We demonstrate that La Niña modifies large-scale moisture transport together with local thermodynamic changes to facilitate local precipitation generation, whereas below-average precipitation during El Niño stems predominantly from increased regional subsidence. These dynamic–thermodynamic processes were often more pronounced during co-occurring La Niña/ negative IOD and El Niño/positive IOD periods. As the SAM is less strongly correlated with ENSO, the impact of co-occurring ENSO and SAM largely depended on the state of ENSO. La Niña–related processes were exacerbated when combined with 1SAM and dampened when combined with 2SAM, and vice versa during El Niño. This new perspective on how interacting climate modes physically influence regional precipitation can help elucidate how model biases affect the simulation of Australian climate, facilitating model improvement and understanding of regional impacts from long-term changes in these modes. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: How climate modes modulate the oceanic and terrestrial sources of moisture for rainfall in east Australia is investigated. East Australia is wetter during La Niña because more moisture is transported into the region and is more easily turned into rainfall when it arrives, whereas drier conditions during El Niño are because local conditions inhibit the conversion of moisture into rainfall. Distant atmospheric changes over the Indian and Southern Oceans can intensify these changes. Our results can be used to better understand and predict the regional impact of long-term changes in these modes of climate variability, which are potentially altered under climate change."

Heat gained from upwelling and watermass transformation in the eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean (PO) is transported through the ITF into the Indian Ocean, ultimately connecting to high-latitude regions of heat loss such as the North Atlantic. However, state-of-the-art General Circulation Models (GCMs) often poorly simulate upwelling, particularly in the eastern Pacific boundary regions. Recent studies have hypothesized that these difficulties may be related to biases in downstream ITF volume and heat transport, whereby insufficient warm surface water from the western PO passes through the ITF, a complex region that is hard to accurately represent in models. Here, we test this hypothesis using a coarse-resolution ocean model by artificially widening the ITF and allowing greater quantities of warm water to exit the western PO. This reduces the Indo-Pacific sea-surface height and pressure gradient biases. Using diagnostics in temperature coordinates, we trace the source of increased ITF warm-water transport to enhanced watermass transformation of cold-to-warm waters in the eastern tropical PO. Additional cool water is brought to the surface in the Cold Tongue region, resulting in an enhancement of surface flux-driven warming. However, we find only limited evidence for changes in upwelling at lower temperatures along the eastern PO margins, considerably less than hypothesized in a previous study. Our experiment provides useful insights to help understand simulated ITF mass and heat transport biases and their links with the tropical PO in GCMs."

Examination of a limited number of past events suggests that certain co-occurring terrestrial and marine heatwaves have common drivers. Co-occurring events may also interact via local land-sea interactions, thereby altering the likelihood of these events. This study explores possible links between adjacent coastal marine and terrestrial heatwaves around Australia using observation and reanalysis data. We find a significant increase in the number of terrestrial heatwave days in the presence of an adjacent co-occurring marine heatwave along the coastal belt of Australia. In most regions, this increase persists at least 150 km inland. This suggests that processes operating beyond the narrow coastal belt are important in most regions. We also show that synoptic conditions driving a terrestrial heatwave in three locations around Australia are conducive for warming the ocean, which would increase the likelihood of a marine heatwave occurring. However, ocean state must also be conducive to reach MHW conditions. Our findings suggest that co-occurring terrestrial and marine heatwaves co-occur more frequently than chance would dictate, and that large scale synoptics may be conducive to both coastal terrestrial and marine heatwaves."

To help resolve this question we calculate probability distributions of the committed warming that would ensue if all anthropogenic emissions were stopped immediately, or at successive future times. We use a simple Earth system model together with a Bayesian approach that incorporates multiple lines of evidence and accounts for known model biases. This analysis reveals a wide range of possible outcomes, including no further warming, but also a 15% chance of overshooting the 1.5 °C target, and 1%-2% chance for 2 °C, even if all emissions had stopped in 2020. If emissions merely stabilize in 2020 and stop in 2040, these probabilities increase to 90% and 17%. The uncertainty arises mainly from that of present forcing by aerosols. Rather than there being a fixed date by which emissions must stop, the probability of reaching either target - which is already below 100% - gradually diminishes with delays in eliminating emissions, by 3%-4% per year for 1.5 °C."

They can affect regional climate and strongly influence the dispersion and distribution of marine species. Using state-of-the-art climate models from the latest and previous Climate Model Intercomparison Projects, we evaluate upper ocean circulation and examine future projections, focusing on subtropical and low-latitude WBCs. Despite their coarse resolution, climate models successfully reproduce most large-scale circulation features with ensemble mean transports typically within the range of observational uncertainty, although there is often a large spread across the models and some currents are systematically too strong or weak. Despite considerable differences in model structure, resolution and parameterisations, many currents show highly consistent projected changes across the models. For example, the East Australian Current, Brazil Current and Agulhas Current extensions are projected to intensify, while the Gulf Stream, Indonesian Throughflow and Agulhas Current are projected to weaken. Intermodel differences in most future circulation changes can be explained in part by projected changes in the large-scale surface winds. In moving to the latest model generation, despite structural model advancements, we find little systematic improvement in the simulation of ocean transports nor major differences in the projected changes."

In the Southern Hemisphere, strong warming over the WBC extensions has been observed over the last few decades, with enhanced warming projected into the future. This amplified warming has primarily been linked to poleward intensification of the mid-latitude westerly winds in the Southern Hemisphere. Changes in these winds are often thought of as being zonally symmetric; however, recent studies show that they contain strong zonal asymmetries in certain ocean basins. The importance of these zonal asymmetries for the Southern Ocean has not yet been investigated. In this study, we use an ocean-sea-ice model forced by prescribed atmospheric fields to quantify the contribution of projected zonally asymmetric atmospheric changes in generating future ocean warming and circulation changes in the subtropical WBC regions. We find that the zonally asymmetric component of atmospheric forcing, characterized by a pattern that is consistent across CMIP6 models, can explain more than 30% (>2°C) of the sea surface temperature (SST) warming found in the Tasman Sea and southern Australia region and a sizable fraction of warming in the Agulhas Current region. These changes in SST in both the Indian and Pacific basins are found to be primarily driven by increases in the advection of warm tropical water to the mid-latitudes due to changes in the large-scale subtropical ocean gyres, which in turn can largely be explained by changes in the mid-latitude surface wind stress patterns."

The fully coupled model is shown to be capable of reproducing correctly relevant features such as the seasonality, spatial distribution and intensity of ECLs while it partially resolves mesoscale processes, such as air-sea feedbacks over ocean eddies and fronts. The mesoscale thermal feedback (TFB) and the current feedback (CFB) are shown to influence the intensity of northern ECLs (north of (Formula presented.)), with the TFB modulating the pre-storm sea surface temperature (SST) by shifting ECL locations eastwards and the CFB modulating the wind stress. By fully uncoupling the atmospheric model of NOW, the intensity of northern ECLs is increased due to the absence of the cold wake that provides a negative feedback to the cyclone. The number of ECLs might also be affected by the air-sea feedbacks but large interannual variability hampers significant results with short-term simulations. The TFB and CFB modify the climatology of SST (mean and variability) but no direct link is found between these changes and those noticed in ECL properties. These results show that the representation of ECLs, mainly north of (Formula presented.), depend on how air-sea feedbacks are simulated. This is particularly important for atmospheric downscaling of climate projections as small-scale SST interactions and the effects of ocean currents are not accounted for."

This pattern is present in both the mean atmospheric circulation and its variability on daily, seasonal and interannual timescales. While the zonal wave 3 pattern has substantial impacts on meridional heat transport and Antarctic sea ice extent, the reason for its existence remains uncertain, although it has long been assumed to be linked to the presence of three major landmasses in the Southern Hemisphere extratropics. Here we use an atmospheric general circulation model to show that the stationary zonal wave 3 pattern is instead driven by zonally asymmetric deep convection in the tropics, with little influence from extratropical orography or landmasses. Localized regions of deep convection in the tropics form a local Hadley cell, which in turn creates a wave source in the subtropics that excites a poleward- and eastward-propagating wave train, forming quasi-stationary waves in the Southern Hemisphere high latitudes. Our findings suggest that changes in tropical deep convection, either due to natural variability or climate change, fundamentally control the zonal wave 3 pattern, with implications for southern high-latitude climate, ocean circulation and sea ice."

Additionally, model intercomparisons show a large spread in the magnitude of Arctic warming for these warmer-than-modern climates. Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain these disagreements, including the unrealistic representation of polar clouds or underestimated poleward heat transport in the models. This study provides an intercomparison of Arctic cloud and atmospheric heat transport (AHT) responses to strong imposed polar-amplified surface ocean warming across four atmosphere-only GCMs. All models simulate an increase in high clouds throughout the year; the resulting reduction in longwave radiation loss to space acts to support the imposed Arctic warming. The response of low- and midlevel clouds varies considerably across the models, with models responding differently to surface warming and sea ice removal. The AHT is consistently weaker in the imposed warming experiments due to a large reduction in dry static energy transport that offsets a smaller increase in latent heat transport, thereby opposing the imposed surface warming. Our idealized polar amplification experiments require very large increases in implied ocean heat transport (OHT) to maintain steady state. Increased CO2 or tropical temperatures that likely characterized past warm climates reduce the need for such large OHT increases."

We find that increases to future marine heatwave statistics are primarily caused by changes in the mean temperature, with changes in variability important in some areas. Temperature variance changes are most prominent close to Tasmania, with a covariance temperature budget demonstrating that this is linked to large simulated increases in East Australian Current transport and variability. Close to New Zealand, changes in surface heat fluxes also play an important role. These results quantify the response of marine heatwave characteristics to future temperature changes."

Reconstruction of propagating ENSO-induced sea-level anomalies from the simulation using an optimized linear wave model with dissipation highlights the prominent role of baroclinic, rather than barotropic, Rossby waves in modulating sea-surface heights. Between 9.5° and 18.5°S, El Niño-associated anomalous anticyclonic wind-stress fields initiate downwelling Rossby waves, potentially influencing SWIO regional climate around 1–4 seasons after El Niño peak, while also destructively interfering with upwelling waves triggered on the eastern boundary by oceanic teleconnections. Further south, weaker ENSO winds, dissipation, non-linear processes, and interference from higher-mode Rossby waves limit ENSO influences in the SWIO. In the model, ENSO-associated predictability is therefore constrained by the “atmospheric” rather than “oceanic” bridge."

These studies have proposed different hypotheses to explain the presence of the ASL, however, a clear understanding of the mechanisms responsible for the generation of the ASL remains uncertain. Here we use an atmospheric general circulation model to show that the ASL is a consequence of the interaction between Antarctic topography and the westerly wind jet, with negligible influence from low-latitude teleconnections.

The combination of climate variability and long-term climate trends generated the climate extremes experienced in 2019, and the compounding effects of two or more modes of climate variability in their fire-promoting phases (as occurred in 2019) has historically increased the chances of large forest fires occurring in southeast Australia. Palaeoclimate evidence also demonstrates that fire-promoting phases of tropical Pacific and Indian ocean variability are now unusually frequent compared with natural variability in preindustrial times. Indicators of forest fire danger in southeast Australia have already emerged outside of the range of historical experience, suggesting that projections made more than a decade ago that increases in climate-driven fire risk would be detectable by 2020, have indeed eventuated. The multiple climate change contributors to fire risk in southeast Australia, as well as the observed non-linear escalation of fire extent and intensity, raise the likelihood that fire events may continue to rapidly intensify in the future. Improving local and national adaptation measures while also pursuing ambitious global climate change mitigation efforts would provide the best strategy for limiting further increases in fire risk in southeast Australia."

This study applies a marine heatwave framework to analyse a global sea surface temperature product and identify the most extreme events, based on their intensity, duration and spatial extent. Many of these events have yet to be described in terms of their physical attributes, generation mechanisms, or ecological impacts. Our synthesis identifies commonalities between marine heatwave characteristics and seasonality, links to the El Niño-Southern Oscillation, triggering processes and impacts on ocean productivity. The most intense events preferentially occur in summer, when climatological oceanic mixed layers are shallow and winds are weak, but at a time preceding climatological maximum sea surface temperatures. Most subtropical extreme marine heatwaves were triggered by persistent atmospheric high-pressure systems and anomalously weak wind speeds, associated with increased insolation, and reduced ocean heat losses. Furthermore, the most extreme events tended to coincide with reduced chlorophyll-a concentration at low and mid-latitudes. Understanding the importance of the oceanic background state, local and remote drivers and the ocean productivity response from past events are critical steps toward improving predictions of future marine heatwaves and their impacts."

Here we investigate rainfall changes in the mid-Pliocene Warm Period (~ 3 Ma), a time when temperatures were 2–3ºC warmer than the pre-industrial era, using output from the Pliocene Model Intercomparison Projects phases 1 and 2 and sensitivity climate model experiments. In the Mid-Pliocene simulations, the higher rates of warming in the northern hemisphere create an interhemispheric temperature gradient that enhances the southward cross-equatorial energy flux by up to 48%. This intensified energy flux reorganizes the atmospheric circulation leading to a northward shift of the Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone and a weakened and poleward displaced Southern Hemisphere Subtropical Convergences Zones. These changes result in drier-than-normal Southern Hemisphere tropics and subtropics. The evaluation of the mid-Pliocene adds a constraint to possible future warmer scenarios associated with differing rates of warming between hemispheres."

Using the historical simulation from 32 fifth phase of Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) models and 34 CMIP6 models, here we find that there are some modest changes in the basic characteristics of the IOD and ENSO from CMIP5 to CMIP6. Firstly, there is a slight shift in the seasonality of IOD toward an earlier peak in September in CMIP6, from November in CMIP5. Secondly, inter-model spread in the frequency of ENSO and the IOD has reduced in CMIP6 relative to CMIP5. ENSO asymmetry is still underestimated in CMIP6, based on the skewness of the Niño3 index, while the IOD skewness has degraded from CMIP5. Finally, mean state SST biases impact on the strength of the IOD; the Pacific cold tongue mean state is important in CMIP5, but in CMIP6 the Pacific warm pool mean state is more important."

In this Perspective, we explore MHW predictability on short-term, interannual to decadal, and centennial timescales, focusing on the physical processes that offer prediction. While there may be potential predictability of MHWs days to years in advance, accuracy will vary dramatically depending on the regions and drivers.

The CMIP5 multimodel mean (MMM) projection suggests up to 5°C of warming under an RCP85 scenario by 2100. Previous studies employed Sverdrup balance to associate a trend in basin wide zonally integrated wind stress curl (resulting from the multidecadal poleward intensification in the westerly winds over the Southern Ocean) with enhanced transport in the EAC extension. Possible regional drivers are yet to be considered. Here we introduce the NEMO-OASIS-WRF coupled regional climate model as a framework to improve our understanding of CMIP5 projections. We analyze a hierarchy of simulations in which the regional atmosphere and ocean circulations are allowed to freely evolve subject to boundary conditions that represent present-day and CMIP5 RCP8.5 climate change anomalies. Evaluation of the historical simulation shows an EAC extension that is stronger than similar ocean-only models and observations. This bias is not explained by a linear response to differences in wind stress. The climate change simulations show that regional atmospheric CMIP5 MMM anomalies drive 73% of the projected 12 Sv increase in EAC extension transport whereas the remote ocean boundary conditions and regional radiative forcing (greenhouse gases within the domain) play a smaller role. The importance of regional changes in wind stress curl in driving the enhanced EAC extension is consistent with linear theory where the NEMO-OASIS-WRF response is closer to linear transport estimates compared to the CMIP5 MMM."

Here we examine the importance of sub-daily air-sea interactions over the Maritime Continent region to the rectification of longer timescale variation. In order to determine the importance of these high-frequency interactions, we conducted two regional ocean–atmosphere coupled simulations over the Maritime Continent where exchanges between the oceanic and atmospheric components are performed either every hour (i.e. resolving diurnal changes) or every day. We find that coupling frequency has a significant influence on mean sea surface temperature (SST) and the mean state and diurnal cycle of rainfall over certain regions of the western Maritime Continent where air-sea interactions are strong during the Asian monsoon season, with little effect in other regions or seasons. Without sub-daily air-sea interactions, the mean SST along the southwest off Sumatra is ~ 2 °C warmer during the period from June to October as a result of a deepening of thermocline along the coast. This deepening is linked to anomalous downwelling equatorial eastward propagating Kelvin waves triggered by westerly anomalies in the eastern equatorial Indian Ocean. In addition, the mean rainfall in the vicinity of ocean warming increases, thereby producing an enhanced barrier layer that also provides a positive warming feedback. Although the coupling frequency has little impact on the timing of the rainfall diurnal cycle, suppression of sub-daily coupling significantly changes the diurnal rainfall amplitude causing a relative decrease (increase) in amplitude over the coast of Northwestern (Southwestern) Sumatra during the South Asian monsoon season."

This is largely attributable to oceanic pathways that transfer ENSO-associated anomalies around the Pacific and into other basins. While the impact of atmospheric teleconnections occurs over days to weeks, oceanic teleconnections permit a memory of anomalous air-sea coupling during ENSO to persist months to years. ENSO-generated ocean perturbations are transmitted to remote regions by planetary waves. Equatorial Kelvin waves generated by intraseasonal western Pacific wind bursts travel along the equator to the eastern basin and excite coastally trapped waves that extend ENSO’s reach to high latitudes along the American coastlines. Rossby waves that either radiate from the coast with the passage of these Kelvin waves or are generated in the ocean interior by ENSO-related wind anomalies propagate signals westward across the basin, rapidly altering tropical circulation and affecting subtropical gyres. At the leaky western boundary, the waves excited by ENSO radiate and scatter through the Indonesian seas to enter the Indian Ocean. This chapter discusses key mechanisms and highlights evidence for transport and property changes attributable to remote ENSO forcing in the tropical Pacific mediated by oceanic teleconnections."

Here we assess whether climate models from Phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) project robust changes in ENSO’s regional temperature and precipitation teleconnections in the late 21st century, comparing the historical simulations (between 1950 and 1999) and high-emission future simulations (between 2040 and 2089). In order to quantify the importance of internal variability in these projected changes, we examine an ensemble of coupled model simulations from the Max-Planck-Institute Grand Ensemble (MPI-GE). Except for a few regions, the changes in ENSO’s temperature and precipitation teleconnections for most regions are not significant across the majority of models. Exceptions include consistent projected changes to temperature teleconnections over equatorial South America and East Africa, which are robust during La Niña events. Despite this, by assessing all regions together, a significant amplification of the temperature teleconnections is identified for La Niña events. Additionally, we find an overall projected weakening relative to the historical precipitation teleconnection when analysis is limited to regions that correctly reproduce the observed precipitation teleconnections. It remains unclear to what extent a change in regional ENSO teleconnections will be apparent, as it is clear that the changes in ENSO’s teleconnections are relatively small compared to the regional variability during the historical period."

Projected future climate impacts have also been described, mainly focused on a reduced impact of the mid-latitude jet as the ozone hole gradually repairs. However, there is little appreciation of the surface warming that has been avoided as a result of the Montreal Protocol, despite CFCs being potent greenhouse gases. Instead, the issue of ozone depletion and climate change are often thought of as two distinct problems, even though both ozone and CFCs impact Earth's radiation budget. Here we show that a substantial amount of warming has been avoided because of the Montreal Protocol, even after factoring in the surface cooling associated with stratospheric ozone depletion. As of today, as much as 1.1 °C warming has been avoided over parts of the Arctic. Future climate benefits are even stronger, with 3 °C-4 °C Arctic warming and ∼1 °C global average warming avoided by 2050; corresponding to a ∼25% mitigation of global warming. The Montreal Protocol has thus not only been a major success in repairing the stratospheric ozone hole, it has also achieved substantial mitigation of anthropogenic climate change both today and into the future."

Several prominent MHWs have attracted scientific and public interest, and recent assessments have documented global and regional increases in their frequency. However, for proactive marine management, it is critical to understand how patterns might change in the future. Here, we estimate future changes in MHWs to the end of the 21st century, as simulated by the CMIP5 global climate model projections. Significant increases in MHW intensity and count of annual MHW days are projected to accelerate, with many parts of the ocean reaching a near-permanent MHW state by the late 21st century. The two greenhouse gas (GHG) emission scenarios considered (Representative Concentration Pathway 4.5 and 8.5) strongly affect the projected intensity of MHW events, the proportion of the globe exposed to permanent MHW states, and the occurrence of the most extreme MHW events. Comparison with simulations of a natural world, without anthropogenic forcing, indicate that these trends have emerged from the expected range of natural variability within the first half of the 21st century. This discrepancy implies a degree of “anthropogenic emergence,” with a departure from the natural MHW conditions that have previously shaped marine ecosystems for centuries or even millennia.

We compare model ensemble seasonal-to-annual volume transports to observations and explore drivers of past and future circulation variability and change. Off the west coast of Australia, models consistently project a weakening of the Leeuwin Current and Undercurrent due to reduced onshore flow and downwelling. The reduced onshore flow is related to changes in the alongshore pressure gradient. While the alongshore pressure gradient change is consistent with the Indonesian Throughflow projected weakening, we found no inter-model relationship between these changes. In the south-western Indian Ocean, the models project a robust weakening of the North East and South East Madagascar Currents, Agulhas Current and transport through the Mozambique Channel. This reduced Indian Ocean western boundary flow is partly associated with a weaker Indonesian Throughflow and overturning circulation, where the latter is related to a decrease in the convergence of deep Southern Ocean waters into the Indian Ocean. In contrast to the weakening of other features, the westward flowing Agulhas Current extension south of Africa is projected to strengthen, which is consistent with an intensification of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current."

The use of dFADs also impacts ecosystems, in particular through marine pollution and dFAD beaching. This paper presents the first estimate of dFAD beaching events in the WCPO (>1300 in 2016–2017) and their distribution. Lagrangian simulations of virtual dFADs, released subject to contrasting deployment distributions, help us determine the relative importance of operational versus environmental drivers of dFADs drifting to beaching areas. The highest levels of beaching, occurring on Papua New Guinea and Solomon Islands, are likely a result of the prevailing westward oceanic circulation and subsequent local processes driving dFADs towards land. Similarly, high beaching rates in Tuvalu appear to be due to the general circulation of the WCPO. In contrast, beaching in Kiribati Gilbert Islands appear to be more strongly related to dFAD deployment strategy. These findings indicate that reducing beaching events via changes in deployment locations may be difficult. As such, management approaches combining dFAD deployment limits, the use of biodegradable dFADs, recoveries at-sea close to sensitive areas and/or beached dFAD removal should be considered."

Using ensemble simulations from three different climate models starting from different initial conditions, we find a large spread in projected 20-year globally averaged surface air temperature trends that can be linked to differences in Pacific climate variability. This implies diminished predictive skill for global surface air temperature trends over decadal timescales, to a large extent due to intrinsic Pacific Ocean variability. We show, however, that this uncertainty can be considerably reduced when the initial oceanic state is known and well represented in the model. In this case, the spatial patterns of 20-year surface air temperature trends depend largely on the initial state of the Pacific Ocean."

However, climate models struggle to realistically simulate rainfall and the skill of rainfall prediction in decadal experiments is poor. Here, we examine how predictions of sea surface temperature anomaly (SSTA) indices from Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 decadal experiments can provide skillful rainfall forecasts at interannual timescales for Australia. Forecasts of commonly used SSTA indices relevant to Australian seasonal rainfall are derived from decadal hindcasts of six different climate models and corrected for model drift. The corrected indices are then combined to form a multimodel ensemble. The resultant forecasts are used as predictors in a statistical rainfall model developed in this study. As SSTA forecasts lose skill with increasing lead time, a new methodology for predicting interannual rainfall is proposed. We allow our statistical prediction model to evolve with lead time while accounting for the loss of skill in SSTA forecasts instead of using one statistical model for all lead times. Results in this pilot study across two of the largest climate zones in Australia show that SSTA outputs from the decadal experiments provide enhanced skill in rainfall prediction over using the conventional model (based purely on lagged observed indices) up to a maximum of three years ahead. This methodology could be used more broadly for other regions around the world where rainfall variability is known to have strong links to ocean temperatures."

Here we show from observations that such droughts and adjacent marine heatwaves have a common remote cause. Atmospheric blocking triggered by tropical convection in the Indian and Pacific oceans can cause persistent anticyclonic circulation that not only leads to severe drought but also generates marine heatwaves in the adjacent ocean. We show that increased shortwave radiation due to reduced cloud cover and reduced ocean heat loss from weaker winds are the main contributors to the establishment of marine heatwaves in the region. The proposed mechanism, which involves droughts, extreme air temperature over land and atmospheric blocking explains approximately 60% of the marine heatwave events in the western South Atlantic.

The initial findings of the TPOS 2020 Project embrace new strategic approaches and technologies in a user-driven design and the variable focus of the Framework for Ocean Observing. User requirements arise from climate prediction and research, climate change and the climate record, and coupled modeling and data assimilation more generally. Requirements include focus on the upper ocean and air-sea interactions, sampling of diurnal variations, finer spatial scales and emerging demands related to biogeochemistry and ecosystems. One aim is to sample a diversity of climatic regimes in addition to the equatorial zone. The status and outlook for meeting the requirements of the design are discussed. This is accomplished through integrated and complementary capabilities of networks, including satellites, moorings, profiling floats and autonomous vehicles. Emerging technologies and methods are also discussed. The outlook highlights a few new foci of the design: biogeochemistry and ecosystems, low-latitude western boundary currents and the eastern Pacific. Low latitude western boundary currents are conduits of tropical-subtropical interactions, supplying waters of mid to high latitude origin to the western equatorial Pacific and into the Indonesian Throughflow. They are an essential part of the recharge/discharge of equatorial warm water volume at interannual timescales and play crucial roles in climate variability on regional and global scales. The tropical eastern Pacific, where extreme El Niño events develop, requires tailored approaches owing to the complex of processes at work there involving coastal upwelling, and equatorial cold tongue dynamics, the oxygen minimum zone and the seasonal double Intertropical Convergence Zone. A pilot program building on existing networks is envisaged, complemented by a process study of the East Pacific ITCZ/warm pool/cold tongue/stratus coupled system. The sustainability of TPOS depends on effective and strong collaborative partnerships and governance arrangements. Revisiting regional mechanisms and engaging new partners in the context of a planned and systematic design will ensure a multi-purpose, multi-faceted integrated approach that is sustainable and responsive to changing needs."

A greater understanding of the spatiotemporal dynamics of these objects as they drift with ocean currents is critical for understanding historical changes in fishing power, spatial management, and examining the effect of ambient dFAD density on catch and effort. Here, dFAD dynamics were estimated for all floating object sets made by purse seiners in the Western and Central Pacific Ocean during 2016 and 2017. The drift trajectories of these floating objects prior to the observed fishing events were estimated by seeding virtual Lagrangian particles within a state-of-the-art hydrodynamics model, and simulating their movements backwards in time. Resulting trajectory distributions are similar to observed dFAD trajectories from the same period. The approach provides spatial density estimates in areas where observed dFAD data are incomplete, particularly in the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) of Howland and Baker Islands, and certain high seas areas. We provide estimates of inter-EEZ connectivity of dFADs, which highlight the fact that dFADs set upon in small EEZs such as Nauru and Howland and Baker Islands are likely to have drifted from neighbouring EEZs less than one month prior to fishing. dFADs typically transited multiple EEZs, with a median of 4 and a maximum of 14, when assuming a drift-time of six months. Moreover, between 4 and 22% of dFAD sets made in the WCPO were estimated to have originated from the Eastern Pacific Ocean, depending on drift-time. We examine our results in the context of the improved management and assessment of dFAD fisheries, providing a methodology to estimated relative dFAD density over historical periods to support analyses of catch and effort.

Techniques currently used to observe boundary current systems are reviewed, followed by a census of the current state of boundary current observing systems globally. Next steps in the development of boundary current observing systems are considered, leading to several specific recommendations."

Recent prominent marine heatwaves have attracted considerable scientific and public interest. Despite this, a comprehensive assessment of how these ocean temperature extremes have been changing globally is missing. Using a range of ocean temperature data including global records of daily satellite observations, daily in situ measurements and gridded monthly in situ-based data sets, we identify significant increases in marine heatwaves over the past century. We find that from 1925 to 2016, global average marine heatwave frequency and duration increased by 34% and 17%, respectively, resulting in a 54% increase in annual marine heatwave days globally. Importantly, these trends can largely be explained by increases in mean ocean temperatures, suggesting that we can expect further increases in marine heatwave days under continued global warming."

Recent studies have identified Pacific decadal variability as a major driver of periods of rapid and slower global mean surface air temperature change. Here, we use an eddy-permitting global ocean model to investigate the role of the observed 1992–2011 trade wind intensification and concurrent trends in surface atmospheric variables over the Pacific associated with the negative phase of the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation (IPO) in driving ocean circulation and heat content changes. We find a strengthening of the Equatorial Undercurrent (EUC) in response to strengthened winds, which brings cooler water to the surface of the eastern Pacific and an increase in the Pacific shallow overturning cells (PSOC), which in turn drives additional heat into the subsurface western Pacific. The wind acceleration also results in an increase in the strength and subsequent heat transport of the Indonesian throughflow (ITF), which transports some of the additional heat from the western Pacific into the Indian Ocean. The circulation changes result in warming of the subsurface western Pacific, cooling of the upper eastern Pacific Ocean and warming of the subsurface Indian Ocean, with an overall increase in Indo-Pacific heat content. Further experiments impose a symmetric reversal of the atmospheric state to examine how the ocean would behave if the winds (and other atmospheric variables) were to revert to their initial state. This mimics a return to the neutral phase of the IPO, characterised by a weakening of the Pacific trade winds. In response we find a slowdown of the EUC and the PSOC, which results in a return to climatological SST conditions in the western and eastern Pacific. The ITF also slows towards its original strength. However, the subsurface temperature, heat content and ITF responses are not symmetric due to an overall increase in the surface heat flux into the ocean associated with the cooler surface of the Pacific. There may also be irreversible heat transport across the thermocline via diapycnal mixing, further contributing to this asymmetry. The net result of the experiment is that the Indo-Pacific subsurface ocean is warmer than it was in its initial state."

Discrete, climatically extreme events such as cyclones, floods, and heatwaves can also significantly affect regional environments and species, including humans. Climate change is expected to intensify these events and thus exacerbate their effects. Climatic extremes also occur in the ocean, and recent decades have seen many high-impact marine heatwaves (MHWs)—anomalously warm water events that may last many months and extend over thousands of square kilometers. A range of biological, economic, and political impacts have been associated with the more intense MHWs, and measuring the severity of these phenomena is becoming more important. Progress in understanding and public awareness will be facilitated by consistent description of these events. Here, we propose a detailed categorization scheme for MHWs that builds on a recently published classification, combining elements from schemes that describe atmospheric heatwaves and hurricanes. Category I, II, III, and IV MHWs are defined based on the degree to which temperatures exceed the local climatology and illustrated for 10 MHWs. While there is a long-term increase in the occurrence frequency of all MHW categories, the largest trend is a 24% increase in the area of the ocean where strong (Category II) MHWs occur. Use of this scheme can help explain why biological impacts associated with different MHWs can vary widely and provides a consistent way to compare events. We also propose a simple naming convention based on geography and year that would further enhance scientific and public awareness of these marine events."

Conversely, Lagrangian, or individual-based, models simulate the movement of individual particles moving in continuous space, with broader-scale patterns such as distribution being an emergent property of many, potentially adaptive, individuals. These models offer advantages in examining dynamics across spatiotemporal scales and making comparisons with observations from individual-scale data. Here, we introduce and describe such a model, the Individual-based Kinesis, Advection and Movement of Ocean ANimAls model (Ikamoana), which we use to replicate the movement processes of an existing Eulerian model for marine predators (the Spatial Ecosystem and Population Dynamics Model, SEAPODYM). Ikamoana simulates the movement of either individual or groups of animals by physical ocean currents, habitat-dependent stochastic movements (kinesis), and taxis movements representing active searching behaviours. Applying our model to Pacific skipjack tuna (Katsuwonus pelamis), we show that it accurately replicates the evolution of density distribution simulated by SEAPODYM with low time-mean error and a spatial correlation of density that exceeds 0.96 at all times. We demonstrate how the Lagrangian approach permits easy tracking of individuals’ trajectories for examining connectivity between different regions, and show how the model can provide independent estimates of transfer rates between commonly used assessment regions. In particular, we find that retention rates in most assessment regions are considerably smaller (up to a factor of 2) than those estimated by this population of skipjack's primary assessment model. Moreover, these rates are sensitive to ocean state (e.g. El Nino vs La Nina) and so assuming fixed transfer rates between regions may lead to spurious stock estimates. A novel feature of the Lagrangian approach is that individual schools can be tracked through time, and we demonstrate that movement between two assessment regions at broad temporal scales includes extended transits through other regions at finer-scales. Finally, we discuss the utility of this modeling framework for the management of marine reserves, designing effective monitoring programmes, and exploring hypotheses regarding the behaviour of hard-to-observe oceanic animals."

Future bleaching is unlikely to be spatially uniform. Therefore, understanding what determines regional differences will be critical for adaptation management. Here, using a cumulative heat stress metric, we show that characteristics of regional SST determine the future bleaching risk patterns. Incorporating observed information on SST variability, in assessing future bleaching risk, provides novel options for management strategies. As a consequence, the known biases in climate model variability and the uncertainties in regional warming rate across climate models are less detrimental than previously thought. We also show that the thresholds used to indicate reef viability can strongly influence a decision on what constitutes a potential refugia. Observing and understanding the drivers of regional variability, and the viability limits of coral reefs, is therefore critical for making meaningful projections of coral bleaching risk."

Here ENSO temperature and precipitation teleconnections between the historical and high-emission future simulations are compared in 40 models from phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project. Focusing on the global land area only, we show that there are robust increases in the spatial extent of ENSO teleconnections during austral summer in 2040–2089 of ~19% for temperature and ~12% for precipitation in the multimodel mean (MMM), relative to the 1950–1999 period. The MMM further shows that the expansion of ENSO teleconnection extent is at least partly related to a strengthening of ENSO teleconnections over continental regions; however, a consistent strengthening is not found across the individual models. This suggests that while more land may be affected by ENSO, the existing teleconnections may not be simply strengthened."

However, most drift correction studies consider a relatively small sample of variables and models. Here, we present a systematic application of the existing drift correction strategies for decadal predictions of various sea surface temperature-based metrics from a suite of five state-of-the-art climate models (CanCM4i1, GFDL-CM2.1, HadCM3i2&i3, MIROC5, and MPI-ESM-LR). The best method of drift correction for each metric and model is reported. Preliminary analysis suggests that there is no single method of drift correction that consistently performs best. Initial condition-based drift correction provides the lowest errors in most regions for MIROC5 and the two HadCM3 models, whereas the trend-based drift correction produces lowest errors for CanCM4i1, GFDL-CM2.1, and MPI-ESM-LR over the largest share of the area. There is no merit in using a k-nearest neighbor approach for these drift correction methods. Further, in almost all cases, the multimodel ensemble outperforms the individual models, and thus, the study conclusively suggests using forecasts based on multimodel averages. We also show some additional benefit to be gained by drift correcting each model/metric using their best correction method prior to model averaging and suggest that the results presented here would help potential users expend time and resources judiciously while dealing with outputs from these experiments."

Here we examine the relationship between the TBV and regional rainfall, which, if significant, would imply that the TBV predictability could be used to improve rainfall forecasts. We find TBV to be significantly related to rainfall, a relationship that is strongest over Australia during spring. We find Australia to experience drier conditions during the positive phase of TBV and wetter conditions during the negative phase, a pattern similar to that of ENSO. Furthermore, TBV is associated with rainfall responses that are of similar magnitude to ENSO, but there is some degree of independence between TBV and the Pacific modes defined by sea surface temperature indices. The global teleconnections related to the different TBV phases suggest that though many TBV and ENSO events overlap, pure ENSO events are primarily driven by the Pacific whereas pure TBV events are driven by the Atlantic Ocean. An El Niño coupled with a positive TBV event leads to significant drying over the east coast of Australia while the combined negative phase leads to widespread wetting over most of the country, which can be attributed to an enhancement of the anomalous Walker Circulation and the resulting moisture convergence and wind patterns."

This study investigates the sensitivity of rainfall characteristics to resolution in a coupled regional climate model configuration, in particular focusing on processes that modulate the diurnal cycle. Model biases are resolution dependent. Increasing resolution from 3/4° to 1/4° improves the mean state sea surface temperature and precipitation biases. However, at higher resolutions (1/12°) rainfall becomes too strong in most areas. Daily maximum rainfall is simulated about 2–4 h earlier than in observations over both the land and the ocean, with only small improvements over high topography at higher resolution. We develop a technique to examine cross-coastal processes associated with the rainfall diurnal cycle along all coastlines. This is used to investigate the sensitivity of the diurnal cycle to resolution and to the direction of the prevailing wind. During offshore prevailing winds, most land rainfall is confined near the coastline and associated with a shallow land-sea breeze circulation at all resolution (though rainfall partly develops directly inland at 1/12°). During onshore prevailing winds, rainfall propagates from the coastline to the island interior at 1/4° and 1/12°, whereas it appears directly over the island interior at 3/4°, and this is associated with a deep convective cell across the coastline for all resolutions. Oceanic rainfall propagates far offshore during offshore prevailing winds at all resolutions, whereas it tends to remain confined near the coastline under onshore prevailing winds condition, particularly at higher resolution."

Past analysis has revealed that despite the assimilation of observational data, there remain large differences among reanalysis products. Thus, here we examine if satellite-based synthesis products may provide more consistent estimate than reanalysis. Reanalysis product winds are, however, typically used as a background constraint in constructing the synthesis products to fill spatiotemporal gaps and to deal with satellite wind direction ambiguity. Our study identified two important factors that influence both the mean and trends from synthesized wind products. First, the choice of background wind product in synthesized satellite wind products affects the mean and long-term trends, which has implications for simulations of ocean circulation, sea level, and presumably SST. Second, we identify a clear need for developing a better understanding of, and correcting differences between in situ observations of absolute winds with the satellite-derived relative winds prior to synthesizing. This correction requires careful analysis of satellite surface winds with existing colocated in situ measurements of surface winds and currents, and will benefit from near-surface current observations of the proposed Tropical Pacific Observing System. These results also illustrate the difficulty in independently evaluating the synthesis wind products because the in situ data have been utilized at numerous steps during their development. Addressing these identified issues effectively, will require enhanced collaborations among the wind observation (both satellite and in situ), reanalysis, and synthesis communities."

We find that elevated iron concentrations derived from New Guinea Coastal Undercurrent (NGCU) alone is insufficient to explain the high concentrations observed in the EUC. In addition, due to the spread in transit times, interannual NGCU iron pulses are scavenged, diluted, or eroded, before reaching the eastern equatorial Pacific. With an additional iron source from the nearby New Ireland Coastal Undercurrent, EUC iron concentrations become consistent with observations. Furthermore, as both the New Guinea and New Ireland Coastal Undercurrents strengthen during El Niño, increased iron input into the EUC can enhance the iron supply into the eastern equatorial Pacific. Notably, during the 1997/1998 El Niño, this causes a simulated 30% iron increase at a 13 month lag."

Here, we show that the large-scale features of the SA circulation are projected to change significantly under 'business as usual' greenhouse gas increases. Based on 19 models from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5 there is a projected weakening in the upper ocean interior transport (<1000 m) between 15° and ∼32°S, largely related to a weakening of the wind stress curl over this region. The reduction in ocean interior circulation is largely compensated by a decrease in the net deep southward ocean transport (>1000 m), mainly related to a decrease in the North Atlantic deep water transport. Between 30° and 40°S, there is a consistent projected intensification in the Brazil current strength of about 40% (30%-58% interquartile range) primarily compensated by an intensification of the upper interior circulation across the Indo-Atlantic basin. The Brazil-Malvinas confluence is projected to shift southwards, driven by a weakening of the Malvinas current.

On interannual timescales ITF changes are largely related to tropical Pacific wind variability. However, on the multidecadal timescales investigated here we demonstrate that regional winds and associated changes in the upper ocean circulation cannot explain the projected ITF decrease. Instead, the decrease is related to a weakening in the northward flow of deep waters entering the Pacific basin at ~40°S and an associated reduction in the net basin-wide upwelling to the north of the southern tip of Australia. This can be traced back to consistent changes in the Antarctic Circumpolar Current and Southern Ocean overturning, although questions still remain as to the ultimate drivers. In contrast to the ITF decrease, substantial projected changes to the upper ocean circulation of the Pacific basin are well explained by robust changes in the surface winds."

A variety of impacts have been associated with these anomalous events, including shifts in species ranges, local extinctions and economic impacts on seafood industries through declines in important fishery species and impacts on aquaculture. Extreme temperatures are increasingly seen as important influences on biological systems, yet a consistent definition of MHWs does not exist. A clear definition will facilitate retrospective comparisons between MHWs, enabling the synthesis and a mechanistic understanding of the role of MHWs in marine ecosystems. Building on research into atmospheric heatwaves, we propose both a general and specific definition for MHWs, based on a hierarchy of metrics that allow for different data sets to be used in identifying MHWs. We generally define a MHW as a prolonged discrete anomalously warm water event that can be described by its duration, intensity, rate of evolution, and spatial extent. Specifically, we consider an anomalously warm event to be a MHW if it lasts for five or more days, with temperatures warmer than the 90th percentile based on a 30-year historical baseline period. This structure provides flexibility with regard to the description of MHWs and transparency in communicating MHWs to a general audience. The use of these metrics is illustrated for three 21st century MHWs; the northern Mediterranean event in 2003, the Western Australia 'Ningaloo Niño' in 2011, and the northwest Atlantic event in 2012. We recommend a specific quantitative definition for MHWs to facilitate global comparisons and to advance our understanding of these phenomena."

Yet the extent to which Australian wet and dry spells can be driven by internal atmospheric variability remains unclear. Natural variability experiments are examined to determine whether prolonged extreme wet and dry periods can arise from internal atmospheric and land variability alone. Results reveal that this is indeed the case; however, these dry and wet events are found to be less severe than in simulations incorporating coupled oceanic variability. Overall, ocean feedback processes increase the magnitude of Australian rainfall variability by about 30% and give rise to more spatially coherent rainfall impacts. Over mainland Australia, ocean interactions lead to more frequent extreme events, particularly during the rainy season. Over Tasmania, in contrast, ocean-atmosphere coupling increases mean rainfall throughout the year. While ocean variability makes Australian rainfall anomalies more severe, droughts and wet spells of duration longer than three years are equally likely to occur in both atmospheric- and ocean-driven simulations. Moreover, they are essentially indistinguishable from what one expects from a Gaussian white noise distribution. Internal atmosphere-landdriven megadroughts and megapluvials that last as long as ocean-driven events are also identified in the simulations. This suggests that oceanic variability may be less important than previously assumed for the longterm persistence of Australian rainfall anomalies. This poses a challenge to accurate prediction of long-term dry and wet spells for Australia."

This study quantifies differences in the two drift estimates in sea surface temperature (SST) and SST anomaly (SSTA) predictions, between experiments initialized every 5 years and those initialized every year. The effect of the recommended mean drift correction, on the two sets of predictions, is also analyzed. Our results indicate that differences between the SST drift estimates are largest over the tropical Pacific. Moreover, this difference is large for Niño 3.4 and almost negligible for the global average SSTA. Drift correction as per the mean drift from the 5 year case leads to spurious peaks in the drift-corrected Niño 3.4 (and the tropical Pacific) and sporadic improvements in skill. This problem with Niño 3.4 stems from an aliasing that occurs during the drift calculation that results from a combination of the timing of major El Niño events in relation to the initialization dates. The study recommends accounting for such sampling effects while considering any subset of the full data set."

These statistical inferences are however limited by the length and uncertainties in the observational records. This paper compares observational datasets with twenty-one 155-yr historical simulations from phase 5 of CMIP (CMIP5) to assess IOD and El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) properties along with their synchronous and delayed relationships. In the observations and most CMIP5models, it is shown that El Niños tend to be followed by La Niñas but not the opposite, that pIODs co-occur more frequently with El Niños than nIODs with La Niñas, that nIODs tend to be followed by El Niños one year later less frequently than pIODs by La Niñas, and that including an IOD index in a linear prediction based on the Pacific warm water volume improves ENSO peak hindcasts at 14 months lead.TheIOD-ENSOdelayed relationship partly results froma combination ofENSOintrinsic properties (e.g., the tendency forElNiños to be followed by LaNiñas) and from the synchronous IOD-ENSOrelationship. The results, however, reveal that this is not sufficient to explain the high prevalence of pIOD-Niña transitions in the observations and 75%of theCMIP5models, and of nIOD-Niño transitions in 60% of CMIP5 models. This suggests that the tendency of IOD to lead ENSO by one year should be explained by a physical mechanism that, however, remains elusive in theCMIP5 models. The ability of many CMIP5models to reproduce the delayed influence of the IOD on ENSO is nonetheless a strong incentive to explore extended-range dynamical forecasts of ENSO."

Large eruptions are associated with co-occurring El Niño and positive IOD events in the ensemble means that peak 6-12 months after the volcanic forcing peaks, marking a significant increase in the likelihood of each event occurring in the Southern Hemisphere (SH) spring/summer posteruption. There is also an ensemble mean La Niña-like response in the third SH summer posteruption, which coincides with a significant increase in the likelihood of a La Niña occurring. Taken together with the initial cooling, this La Niña-like response may increase the persistence of the cool global average surface temperature anomaly after an eruption."

The effect of a recommended drift correction technique and the models' capabilities in simulating two specific El Niño and La Niña events are also examined. The results indicate that the improvement from drift correction is noticeable primarily in the full-field initialized models. Models show skillful predictability at timescales up to maximum a year for most indices, with indices in the tropical Pacific and the Western Indian Ocean having longer predictability horizons than other indices. The multi model ensemble mean shows the highest predictability for the Indian Ocean West Pole Index at 25 months. Models simulate the observed peaks during the El Niño and La Niña events in the Niño 3.4 index with limited success beyond timescales of a year, as expected from the predictability horizons. However, our study of a small number of events and models shows full-field initialized models outperforming anomaly initialized ones in simulating these events at annual timescales."

It is responsible for supplying nutrients to the productive eastern Equatorial Pacific Ocean. Of particular importance is the transport of iron by the EUC; the limiting nutrient in that region. Although the mean circulation and sources of EUC water are reasonably well understood, it is unclear how the contribution of water from these sources to the EUC vary on seasonal to interannual timescales. Here a Lagrangian analysis is applied to the eddy-resolving OFAM3 ocean simulation in order to identity variability in the makeup of the EUC over an 18 year period (1993-2010). While ENSO has an influence on the variability of source transport contributions to the EUC, the signal of increased (decreased) transport of water from the LLWBCs during El Niño (La Niña) periods does not translate to substantial changes in the makeup of the EUC between 165°E and 140°W. It is hypothesized that this is due to the large spread in travel times of water parcels as they travel from the source regions into the EUC. The consequent erosion of transport anomalies generated at the different western boundary source regions associated with ENSO may help explain why previous studies found little relationship between variability in iron fluxes off Papua New Guinea shelves and the chlorophyll response in the eastern tropical Pacific.

Interpreting the outputs from such complex models requires an appreciation of the many different types of modelling frameworks being used and their associated limitations and uncertainties. Both users and developers of particular model components will often have little involvement or understanding of other components within such modelling frameworks. Failure to recognise limitations and uncertainties associated with components and how these uncertainties might propagate throughout modelling frameworks can potentially result in poor advice for resource management. Unfortunately, many of the current integrative frameworks do not propagate the uncertainties of their constituent parts. In this review, we outline the major components of a generic whole of ecosystem modelling framework incorporating the external pressures of climate and fishing. We discuss the limitations and uncertainties associated with each component of such a modelling system, along with key research gaps. Major uncertainties in modelling frameworks are broadly categorised into those associated with (i) deficient knowledge in the interactions of climate and ocean dynamics with marine organisms and ecosystems; (ii) lack of observations to assess and advance modelling efforts and (iii) an inability to predict with confidence natural ecosystem variability and longer term changes as a result of external drivers (e.g. greenhouse gases, fishing effort) and the consequences for marine ecosystems. As a result of these uncertainties and intrinsic differences in the structure and parameterisation of models, users are faced with considerable challenges associated with making appropriate choices on which models to use. We suggest research directions required to address these uncertainties, and caution against overconfident predictions. Understanding the full impact of uncertainty makes it clear that full comprehension and robust certainty about the systems themselves are not feasible. A key research direction is the development of management systems that are robust to this unavoidable uncertainty."

Interpreting the projected changes in the tropical Pacific is complicated by the systematic cold tongue bias and overly westward location of the Warm Pool edge at the equator in coupled models. Here an index based on the maximum zonal salinity gradient is used to differentiate the Warm Pool from the cold tongue in each of 19 CMIP5 models. Warming is then calculated relative to the dynamic edge of the Warm Pool between the second halves of the 20th and 21st Centuries from the RCP8.5 scenario to provide a bias adjusted SST projection.Based on this definition of the edge, while the Warm Pool edge is projected to warm, it is likely to remain within 10° of its present longitude. This is in stark contrast to the large projected eastward displacements of the isotherms that are usually used to define the edge. Adjusting for the edge, warming within the Warm Pool is projected to be fairly uniform with surface water freshening. Projected warming is enhanced over the cold tongue with the net effect of reducing the zonal SST gradient. In contrast, if the warming is calculated without correcting for the edge of the Warm Pool, the warming signature is dominated by the poorer performing models with an overly westward Warm Pool, resulting in enhanced warming across the equatorial Pacific. Bias adjusting realigns the warming signature and reduces the model spread of projected warming. The biased warming signature also introduces spurious meridional and zonal SST gradients. This will potentially alter the behaviour of the atmospheric convergence zones and the dynamics of ENSO which is influenced by the extent of the Warm Pool and zonal SST gradients."

Consistent with the view that marine species are thermally constrained, there is growing evidence that many marine species have already undergone poleward range shifts in line with warming trends. This study uses historical observations of ocean temperature and climate model projections to examine the movement of isotherms that mark the boundaries for species' thermal habitats. In particular, we compare the rates of isotherm movement between different ocean regions and at different time scales and examine to what extent the implied movement is uniform or sporadic. Widespread long-term warming implies poleward shifts of isotherms in almost all regions. However, as the speed of isotherm movement is inversely related to local meridional SST gradients and the pattern of ocean warming is heterogeneous, speeds vary considerably between regions, season and over time. At present on decadal and longer timescales, changes due to low frequency natural SST variability can dominate over human-induced changes. As such, there are multidecadal periods in certain regions when we would expect to see range shifts that are much faster or in the opposite direction to that implied by a monotonic warming. Based on central estimates from the latest suite of climate model projections, median isotherm speeds will be about seven times faster in the 21st century compared to the 20th century under business as usual emissions. Moreover, SST warming is projected to be greater in summer than in winter in most oceanic regions, contrary to what is projected to occur over land. As such net poleward isotherm speeds, particularly in the northern hemisphere summer, are projected to be considerably faster than in winter. Finally we show that isotherms can exhibit erratic migration rates over time, even under uniform warming. Isotherm movement tends to stall at thermal fronts for extended periods of time and then rapidly shift to a new position, marked by more poleward fronts. This implies that species ranges would also be expected to undergo sudden rapid shifts rather than exhibiting a gradual monotonic poleward march."

The CMIP5 models show some improvements upon CMIP3 in the simulation of the climate in the western tropical Pacific in the late 20th century. There are fewer CMIP5 models with very poor skill scores than in CMIP3 for some measures and a small group of the well-performing models in CMIP5 have lower biases than in an equivalent group from CMIP3. These best-performing models could be particularly informative for studying certain climate sensitivities and feedbacks in the region. There is evidence to reject one model as unsuitable for making regional climate projections in the region, and another two models unsuitable for analysis of the South Pacific Convergence Zone (SPCZ). However, while there have been improvements, many of the systematic model biases in the mean climate in CMIP3 are also present in the CMIP5 models. They are primarily related to the shape of the transition between the Indo-Pacific warm pool and equatorial cold tongue, and the associated biases in the position and orientation of the SPCZ and Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone, as well as in the spatial pattern, variability and teleconnections of the West Pacific monsoon, and the simulation of El Niño Southern Oscillation. Overall, the results show that careful interpretation and consideration of biases is required when using CMIP5 outputs for generating regional climate projections for the western tropical Pacific, particularly at the country scale, just as there was with CMIP3."

The likelihood of future hiatus periods is found to be sensitive to the rate of change of anthropogenic forcing. Under high rates of greenhouse gas emissions there is little chance of a hiatus decade occurring beyond 2030, even in the event of a large volcanic eruption.

In marine systems, changes in herbivory and the consequent loss of dominant habitat forming species can result in dramatic community phase shifts, such as from coral to macroalgal dominance when tropical fish herbivory decreases, and from algal forests to 'barrens' when temperate urchin grazing increases. Here, we propose a novel phase-shift away from macroalgal dominance caused by tropical herbivores extending their range into temperate regions. We argue that this phase shift is facilitated by poleward-flowing boundary currents that are creating ocean warming hotspots around the globe, enabling the range expansion of tropical species and increasing their grazing rates in temperate areas. Overgrazing of temperate macroalgae by tropical herbivorous fishes has already occurred in Japan and the Mediterranean. Emerging evidence suggests similar phenomena are occurring in other temperate regions, with increasing occurrence of tropical fishes on temperate reefs. © 2014 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

The spatial pattern of projected sea surface temperature change has a key influence on rainfall changes in the tropical Pacific Ocean. Here it is shown that simple indices of the size of the equatorial peak in the spatial pattern of warming and to a lesser extent the hemispheric asymmetry in warming are useful for classifying the surface temperature change in different models from phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5). Models with a more pronounced equatorial warming show a fairly distinct rainfall response compared to those with more uniform warming, including a greater ""warmer-get-wetter"" or dynamical response, whereby rainfall increases follow the surface warming anomaly. Models with a more uniform warming pattern project a smaller rainfall increase at the equator and a rainfall increase in the southern tropical Pacific, a pattern that is distinct from the multimodel mean of CMIP5. Thus, the magnitude of enhanced equatorial warming and to some extent the hemispheric asymmetry in warming provides a useful framework for constraining rainfall projections. While there is not a simple emergent constraint for enhanced equatorial warming in models in terms of past trends or bias in the current climate, further understanding of the various feedbacks involved in these features could lead to a useful constraint of rainfall for the Pacific region."

The relative importance of these two pathways is examined using virtual Lagrangian particles in a high-resolution nested ocean model. The unprecedented combination of a long integration time within an eddy-permitting ocean model simulation allows the first assessment of the interannual variability of these pathways in a realistic setting. The mean Indonesian Throughflow, as diagnosed by the particles, is 14.3 Sv, considerably higher than the diagnosed average Tasman leakage of 4.2 Sv. The time series of Indonesian Throughflow agrees well with the Eulerian transport through the major Indonesian Passages, validating the Lagrangian approach using transport-tagged particles. While the Indonesian Throughflow is mainly associated with upper ocean pathways, the Tasman leakage is concentrated in the 400-900 m depth range at subtropical latitudes. Over the effective period considered (1968-1994), no apparent relationship is found between the Tasman leakage and Indonesian Throughflow.

Most models realistically simulate the observed intensity and location of maximum sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies during ENSO events. However, there exist systematic biases in the westward extent of ENSOrelated SST anomalies, driven by unrealistic westward displacement and enhancement of the equatorial wind stress in the western Pacific. Almost all CMIP5 models capture the observed asymmetry in magnitude between the warm and cold events (i.e., El Niños are stronger than La Niñas) and between the two types of El Niños: that is, cold tongue (CT) El Niños are stronger than warm pool (WP) El Niños. However, most models fail to reproduce the asymmetry between the two types of La Niñas, with CT stronger thanWPevents, which is opposite to observations. Most models capture the observed peak in ENSO amplitude around December; however, the seasonal evolution of ENSO has a large range of behavior across the models. The CMIP5 models generally reproduce the duration of CT El Niños but have biases in the evolution of the other types of events. The evolution of WP El Niños suggests that the decay of this event occurs through heat content discharge in the models rather than the advection of SST via anomalous zonal currents, as seems to occur in observations.

A variety of mechanisms have been proposed to account for this slowdown in surface warming. A key component of the global hiatus that has been identified is cool eastern Pacific sea surface temperature, but it is unclear how the ocean has remained relatively cool there in spite of ongoing increases in radiative forcing. Here we show that a pronounced strengthening in Pacific trade winds over the past two decades - unprecedented in observations/reanalysis data and not captured by climate models - is sufficient to account for the cooling of the tropical Pacific and a substantial slowdown in surface warming through increased subsurface ocean heat uptake. The extra uptake has come about through increased subduction in the Pacific shallow overturning cells, enhancing heat convergence in the equatorial thermocline. At the same time, the accelerated trade winds have increased equatorial upwelling in the central and eastern Pacific, lowering sea surface temperature there, which drives further cooling in other regions. The net effect of these anomalous winds is a cooling in the 2012 global average surface air temperature of 0.1-0.2C, which can account for much of the hiatus in surface warming observed since 2001. This hiatus could persist for much of the present decade if the trade wind trends continue, however rapid warming is expected to resume once the anomalous wind trends abate. © 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited."

Lagrangian trajectories are obtained by advecting particles within velocity fields derived from hydrodynamic ocean models. For studies of ocean flows on scales ranging from mesoscale up to basin scales, the temporal resolution of the velocity fields should ideally not be more than a few days to capture the high frequency variability that is inherent in mesoscale features. However, in reality, the model output is often archived at much lower temporal resolutions. Here, we quantify the differences in the Lagrangian particle trajectories embedded in velocity fields of varying temporal resolution. Particles are advected from 3-day to 30-day averaged fields in a high-resolution global ocean circulation model. We also investigate whether adding lateral diffusion to the particle movement can compensate for the reduced temporal resolution.Trajectory errors reveal the expected degradation of accuracy in the trajectory positions when decreasing the temporal resolution of the velocity field. Divergence timescales associated with averaging velocity fields up to 30. days are faster than the intrinsic dispersion of the velocity fields but slower than the dispersion caused by the interannual variability of the velocity fields. In experiments focusing on the connectivity along major currents, including western boundary currents, the volume transport carried between two strategically placed sections tends to increase with increased temporal averaging. Simultaneously, the average travel times tend to decrease. Based on these two bulk measured diagnostics, Lagrangian experiments that use temporal averaging of up to nine days show no significant degradation in the flow characteristics for a set of six currents investigated in more detail.

In light of such constraints, a qualitative climate projection approach is presented whereby projections are based on expected changes to the broad-scale climate features, drawing on a review of current literature and new research. Nauru sits in the region subject to seasonal and interannual migrations of the SPCZ. Climate models simulate an overly zonal SPCZ with Nauru lying too close to the dry cold tongue zone. This sets an erroneous base state for Nauru by locating it in a very different climate zone.

Rainfall seasonality is consistent across observations and reanalyses, but most CMIP models produce either a too peaked or a too flat seasonal cycle, with CMIP5 models generally performing better than CMIP3. Considering all North-Australia rainfall, most models reproduce the observed Australian monsoon-El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) teleconnection, with the strength of the relationship dependent on the strength of the simulated ENSO. However, over the Maritime Continent, the simulated monsoon-ENSO connection is generally weaker than observed, depending on the ability of each model to realistically reproduce the ENSO signature in the Warm Pool region. A large part of this bias comes from the contribution of Papua, where moisture convergence seems to be particularly affected by this SST bias. The Indian summer monsoon-ENSO relationship is affected by overly persistent ENSO events in many CMIP models.

Large-scale shoaling of the mixed layer and increases in stratification are expected to impact nutrient provision to the biologically active layer, with flow-on trophic effects on the micronekton. Several oceanic currents are projected to change, including a strengthened upper equatorial undercurrent, which could modify the supply of bioavailable iron to the eastern Pacific. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht."

Maintaining the benefits from the sector is a difficult task, now made more complex by climate change. Here we report how changes to the atmosphere-ocean are likely to affect the food webs, habitats and stocks underpinning fisheries and aquaculture across the region. We found winners and losers - tuna are expected to be more abundant in the east and freshwater aquaculture and fisheries are likely to be more productive. Conversely, coral reef fisheries could decrease by 20% by 2050 and coastal aquaculture may be less efficient. We demonstrate how the economic and social implications can be addressed within the sector - tuna and freshwater aquaculture can help support growing populations as coral reefs, coastal fisheries and mariculture decline. © 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Such changes, referred to as model ""drift,"" may distort the estimate of forced change in transient climate simulations. The importance of drift is examined in comparison to historical trends over recent decades in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP). Comparison based on a selection of metrics suggests a significant overall reduction in the magnitude of drift from phase 3 of CMIP (CMIP3) to phase 5 of CMIP (CMIP5). The direction of both ocean and atmospheric drift is systematically biased in some models introducing statistically significant drift in globally averaged metrics. Nevertheless, for most models globally averaged drift remains weak compared to the associated forced trends and is often smaller than the difference between trends derived from different ensemble members or the error introduced by the aliasing of natural variability. An exception to this is metrics that include the deep ocean (e.g., steric sea level) where drift can dominate in forced simulations. In such circumstances drift must be corrected for using information from concurrent control experiments. Many CMIP5 models now include ocean biogeochemistry. Like physical models, biogeochemical models generally undergo long spinup integrations to minimize drift. Nevertheless, based on a limited subset of models, it is found that drift is an important consideration and must be accounted for. For properties or regions where drift is important, the drift correction method must be carefully considered. The use of a drift estimate based on the full control time series is recommended to minimize the contamination of the drift estimate by internal variability. © 2013 American Meteorological Society."

With a half-life of 30.1 years, Cs-137 has the potential to travel large distances within the ocean. Using an ensemble of regional eddy-resolving simulations, this study investigates the long-term ventilation pathways of the leaked Cs-137 in the North Pacific Ocean. The simulations suggest that the contaminated plume would have been rapidly diluted below 10,000Bq/m3 by the energetic Kuroshio Current and Kurushio Extension by July 2011. Based on our source function of 22 Bq/m3, which sits at the upper range of the published estimates, waters with Cs-137 concentrations >10Bq/m3 are projected to reach the northwestern American coast and the Hawaiian archipelago by early 2014. Driven by quasi-zonal oceanic jets, shelf waters north of 45°N experience Cs-137 levels of 10-30Bq/m3 between 2014 and 2020, while the Californian coast is projected to see lower concentrations (10-20Bq/m3) slightly later (2016-2025). This late but prolonged exposure is related to subsurface pathways of mode waters, where Cs-137 is subducted toward the subtropics before being upwelled from deeper sources along the southern Californian coast. The model suggests that Fukushima-derived Cs-137 will penetrate the interior ocean and spread to other oceanic basins over the next two decades and beyond. The sensitivity of our results to uncertainties in the source function and to inter-annual to multi-decadal variability is discussed. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd."

However, discrepancies exist among these products. This study uses observed Archiving, Validation, and Interpretation of Satellite Oceanographic (AVISO) sea surface height anomalies (SSHAs) as a means to help constrain the fidelity of these products in the tropical region. Each wind stress product is used to force a linear shallow water model (SWM) and the resulting hindcast thermocline depth anomalies are converted to SSHAs. The resulting SSHAs are then assessed to see how well they reproduce the dominant EOF modes of observed variability and the regional (global mean removed) sea level trend (1993-2007) in each of the three ocean basins. While the results suggest that all wind datasets reproduce the observed interannual variability with reasonable fidelity, the two SWM hindcasts that produce the observed linear trend with the highest fidelity are those incorporating interimECMWFRe-Analysis (ERA-Interim) and Wave- and Anemometer-Based Sea Surface Wind (WASWind) forcing. The role of surface wind forcing(i.e., upper ocean heat content redistribution) versus global mean sea level change (i.e., including the additional contributions of glacier and ice sheet melt along with ocean thermal expansion) on the recent dramaticincrease in western equatorial Pacific island sea level is then reassessed. The results suggest that the recent sea level increase cannot be explained solely by wind stress forcing, regardless of the dataset used; rather, the global mean sea level signal is required to fully explain this observed recent abrupt sea level rise and to better explain the sea level variability of the last 50-60 years. © 2012 American Meteorological Society."

An overall improvement in simulation of seasonality for both monsoons is seen in CMIP5 over CMIP3, with most CMIP5 models correctly simulating very low rainfall rates outside of the monsoon season. The predictability resulting from each transition is quantified using a Monte Carlo technique. The transition from strong/weak Indian monsoon to strong/weak Australian monsoon shows °15% enhanced predictability in the observations, in estimating whether the following monsoon will be stronger/weaker than the climatology.

Based on this three-dimensional representation we can accurately measure the amount of water mass remaining in an Agulhas Ring over time and consequently how much heat or salt is released from the structure as it decays. Identification techniques based on relative vorticity or the Okubo-Weiss parameter have previously been developed for a surface snapshot. Extending these methods in the vertical direction in the upper ocean and comparing the decay of all three-dimensional structures obtained by different methods, we demonstrate that our technique is able to define structures that are more coherent over time than classical methods.

This so-called climate drift arises for various reasons including the following: perturbations to the climate system on coupling component models together and deficiencies in model physics and numerics. When examining trends in historical or future climate simulations, it is important to know the error introduced by drift so that action can be taken where necessary. This study assesses the importance of drift for a number of climate properties at global and local scales. To illustrate this, the present paper focuses on simulated trends over the second half of the twentieth century. While drift in globally averaged surface prop- erties is generally considerably smaller than observed and simulated twentieth-century trends, it can still in- troduce nontrivial errors in some models. Furthermore, errors become increasingly important at smaller scales. The direction of drift is not systematic across different models or variables, as such drift is considerably reduced in the multimodel mean. Despite drift being primarily associated with ocean adjustment, it is also apparent in atmospheric variables. For example, most models have local drift magnitudes in surface air and ocean tem- peratures that are typically between 15% and 35% of the twentieth-century simulation trend magnitudes for 1950-2000. Below depths of 1000-2000 m, drift dominates over any forced trend in most regions. As such steric sea level is strongly affected and for some models and regions the sea level trend direction is reversed. Thus depending on the application, drift may be negligible or may make up an important part of the simulated trend. © 2012 American Meteorological Society."

Here, we use a climate model of intermediate complexity, which includes an ocean general circulation model and a fully coupled carbon cycle, in conjunction with present-day observations of inter-annual SST variability to investigate three IPCC representative concentration pathways (RCP 3PD, RCP 4. 5, and RCP 8. 5), and their impact on the environmental stressors of coral reefs related to open ocean SST and open ocean Ω arag over the next 400 years.

Most models also project a reduction in the strength of the equatorial Trade winds. Typically, on ENSO time scales, a weakening of the equatorial easterlies would lead to a reduction in EUC strength in the central Pacific. The strengthening of the EUC projected for longer timescales, can be explained by a robust projected intensification of the south-easterly trade winds and an associated off-equatorial wind-stress curl change in the Southern Hemisphere. This drives the intensification of the NGCU and greater water input to the EUC in the west. A 1-layer shallow water model, driven by projected wind stress trends from the CMIP3 models demonstrates that the projected circulation changes are consistent with a purely wind driven response. While the equatorial winds weaken for both El Nio events and in the projections, the ocean response and the mechanisms driving the projected wind changes are distinct from those operating on interannual timescales. © 2012 by the American Geophysical Union."

In agreement with some recently developed theoretical models, it is found that the overturning can be strongly affected by winds. In particular, the simulated strengthening of large-scale southward transport in the abyss is explicitly driven by zonal wind stress. However, there is a considerable range among the climate models in their projected changes of Southern Ocean wind stress. Furthermore, the strengthening of largescale southward transport tends to be compensated by eddy-induced northward flows in the abyss, particularly at eddy-permitting resolution. As a result, the net Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW) export may only be weakly affected. However, none of the models considered accounts for the possibility that a fraction of the eddy kinetic energy may be converted to diapycnal mixing. If this were the case, the presented energetic arguments suggest that stronger Southern Ocean winds would result in a stronger AABW transport."

In the context of anthropogenic climate change, the ocean acts as an important buffer. The majority of extra heat entering the climate system through enhanced greenhouse forcing, and almost half of the anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) since preindustrial times have been sequestered and stored in the ocean. While mitigating against more rapid temperature rise in the atmosphere, the oceanic absorption of heat and CO2 has impacts on the ocean environment.

The CMIP3 model evaluation undertaken by the Pacific Climate Change Science Program (PCCSP) is presented here. This includes a quantitative assessment of the ability of the models to simulate 3 climate variables: (1) surface air temperature, (2) precipitation and (3) surface wind); 3 climate features: (4) the South Pacific Convergence Zone, (5) the Intertropical Convergence Zone and (6) the West Pacific Monsoon; as well as (7) the El Niño Southern Oscillation, (8) spurious model drift and (9) the long term warming signal. For each of 1 to 9, it is difficult to identify a clearly superior subset of models, but it is generally possible to isolate particularly poor performing models. Based on this analysis, we recommend that the following models be eliminated from the multi-model ensemble, for the purposes of calculating PCCSP climate projections: INM-CM3.0, PCM and GISS-EH (consistently poor performance on 1 to 9); INGV-SXG (strong model drift); GISS-AOM and GISS-ER (poor ENSO simulation, which was considered a critical aspect of the tropical Pacific climate).

During El Niño episodes, the tropical Indian Ocean exhibits two types of SST response: a uniform ""basinwide warming"" and a dipole mode-the Indian Ocean dipole (IOD). While the impacts of the IOD on climate have been extensively studied, the effects of the basinwide warming, particularly in the Southern Hemisphere, have received less attention. The interannual basinwide warming response has important implications for Southern Hemisphere atmospheric circulation because 1) it accounts for a greater portion of the Indian Ocean monthly SST variance than the IOD pattern and 2) its maximum amplitude occurs during austral summer to early autumn, when large parts of Australia, South America, and Africa experience their monsoon. Using observations and numerical experiments with an atmospheric general circulation model forced with historical SST from 1949 to 2005 over different tropical domains, the authors show that the basinwide warming leads to a Gill-Matsuno-type response that reinforces the anomalies caused by changes in the Pacific as part of El Niño. In particular, the basinwide warming drives strong subsidence over Australia, prolonging the dry conditions during January-March, when El Niño-related SST starts to decay. In addition to the anomalous circulation in the tropics, the basinwide warming excites a pair of barotropic anomalies in the Indian Ocean extratropics that induces an anomalous anticyclone in the Great Australian Bight. © 2011 American Meteorological Society."

For the period 1900-2006, observations, reanalysis products, and hindcasts of soil moisture during the cool season (June-October) are used to assess the impacts of El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the Indian Ocean dipole (IOD) on southeastern Australia and the Murray-Darling Basin, two regions that have recently suffered severe droughts. A distinct asymmetry is found in the impacts of the opposite phases of both ENSO and IOD on Australian rainfall and soil moisture. There are significant differences between the dominant drivers of drought at interannual and decadal time scales. On interannual time scales, both ENSO and the IOD modify southeastern Australian soil moisture, with the driest (wettest) conditions over the southeast and more broadly over large parts of Australia occurring during years when an El Niño and a positive IOD event (La Niña and a negative IOD event) co-occur. The atmospheric circulation associated with these responses is discussed. Lower-frequency variability over southeastern Australia, however, including multiyear drought periods, seems to be more robustly related to Indian Ocean temperatures than Pacific conditions. The frequencies of both positive and negative IOD events are significantly different during periods of prolonged drought compared to extended periods of ""normal"" rainfall. In contrast, the frequency of ENSO events remains largely unchanged during prolonged dry and wet periods. For the Murray-Darling Basin, there appears to be a significant influence by La Niña and both positive and negative IOD events.

Using an extended classification for ENSO and Indian Ocean dipole (IOD) events for the past 130 years and reanalyses, we have expanded previous interannual work to show that variations in Indian Ocean conditions modulate the ENSO-Indian monsoon relationship also on decadal timescales. El Nĩo events are frequently accompanied by a significantly reduced Indian monsoon and widespread drought conditions due to anomalous subsidence associated with a shift in the descending branch of the zonal Walker circulation. However, for El Nĩo events that co-occur with positive IOD (pIOD) events, Indian Ocean conditions act to counter El Nĩo's drought-inducing subsidence by enhancing moisture convergence over the Indian subcontinent, with an average monsoon season resulting. Decadal modulations of the frequency of independent and combined El Nĩo and pIOD events are consistent with a strengthened El Nĩo-Indian monsoon relationship observed at the start of the 20th century and the apparent recent weakening of the El Nĩo-Indian monsoon relationship. © 2011 IOP Publishing Ltd."

Observational data, for which a seasonal budget can be computed, and a climate model output, which provides improved spatial and temporal coverage for longer time scales, are examined. The seasonal climatology of the model heat budget is broadly consistent with the observational reconstruction, thus providing certain confidence in extending the model analysis to interannual time scales. To identify the dominant heat budget components, covariance analysis is applied based on the heat budget equation. In addition, the role of the heat budget terms on the generation and decay of temperature anomalies is revealed via a novel temperature variance budget approach. The seasonal evolution of the mixed layer temperature is found to be largely controlled by air-sea heat fluxes, except in the tropics where advection and entrainment are important. A distinct shift in the importance and role of certain heat budget components is shown to be apparent in moving from seasonal to interannual time scales. On these longer time scales, advection gains importance in generating and sustaining anomalies over extensive regions, including the trade wind and midlatitude wind regimes. On the other hand, air-sea heat fluxes tend to drive the evolution of thermal anomalies over subtropical regions including off northwestern Australia. In the tropics, however, they limit the growth of anomalies. Entrainment plays a role in the generation and maintenance of interannual anomalies over localized regions, particularly off Sumatra and over the Seychelles-Chagos Thermocline Ridge. It is further shown that the spatial distribution of the role and importance of these terms is related to oceanographic features of the Indian Ocean.

In such events, northwestern Australia tends to be wetter in January and February when the SST warming is displaced to the central west Pacific, the opposite response to that associated with a traditional El Niño. In addition, during the bounding months, that is, December and March, there is below-average rainfall induced by an anomalous Walker circulation. This behavior tends to narrow and intensify the annual rainfall cycle over northwestern Australia relative to the climatology, causing a delayed monsoonal onset and an earlier retreat over the region. Observational datasets and numerical experiments with a general circulation model are used to examine the atmospheric response to the central west Pacific SST warming. It is shown here that the increase of precipitation, particularly in February, is phased locked to the seasonal cycle when the intertropical convergence zone is displaced southward and the South Pacific convergence zone is strengthened. An interaction between the interannual SST variability associated with El Niño Modoki events and the evolution of the seasonal cycle intensifies deep convection in the central west Pacific, driving a Gill-Matsuno-type response to the diabatic heating. The westward-propagating disturbance associated with the Gill-Matsuno mechanism generates an anomalous cyclonic circulation over northwestern Australia, leading to convergence of moisture and increased precipitation. The Gill-Matsuno-type response overwhelms the subsidence of the anomalous Walker circulation associated with Modoki events over Australia during the peak of the monsoon. © 2010 American Meteorological Society."

This is manifest in a distinct shift in ENSO behavior during the late 1970s. This study investigates mechanisms that may force this interdecadal variability and, in particular, on modulations driven by extratropical Rossby waves. Results from oceanic shallow-water models show that the Rossby wave theory can explain small near-zonal changes in equatorial thermocline depth that can alter the amplitude of simulated ENSO events. However, questions remain over whether the same mechanism operates in more complex coupled general circulation models (CGCMs) and what the magnitude of the resulting change would be. Experiments carried out in a state-of-the-art z-coordinate primitive equation model confirm that the Rossby wave mechanism does indeed operate. The effects of these interactions are further investigated using a partial coupling (PC) technique. This allows for the isolation of the role of wind stress-forced oceanic exchanges between the extratropics and the tropics and the subsequent modulation of ENSO variability. It is found that changes in the background state of the equatorial Pacific thermocline depth, induced by a fixed offequatorial wind stress anomaly, can significantly affect the probability of ENSO events occurring. This confirms the results obtained from simpler models and further validates theories that rely on oceanic wave dynamics to generate Pacific Ocean interdecadal variability. This indicates that an improved predictive capability for seasonal-to-interannual ENSO variability could be achieved through a better understanding of extratropical-to-tropical Pacific Ocean transfers and western boundary processes. Furthermore, such an understanding would provide a physical basis to enhance multiyear probabilistic predictions of ENSO indices. © 2009 American Meteorological Society."

This results in significant rainfall changes for western and southeastern Australia. A reduction (increase) in the meridional SST gradient drives a corresponding response in the atmospheric thickness gradients and results in anomalous dry (wet) conditions over Australia. During simulated wet years, this seems to be due to westerly anomalies in the thermal wind over Australia and anomalous onshore moisture advection, with a suggestion that the opposite occurs during dry conditions. Thus, an asymmetry is seen in the magnitude of the forced circulation and precipitation response between the dry and wet simulations. To assess the relative contribution of the SST anomalies making up the meridional gradient, the SST pattern is decomposed into its constituent ""poles,"" that is, the eastern tropical pole off the northwest shelf of Australia versus the southern pole in the central subtropical Indian Ocean. Overall, the simulated Australian rainfall response is linear with regard to the sign and magnitude of the eastern Indian Ocean SST gradient. The tropical eastern pole has a larger impact on the atmospheric circulation and Australian precipitation changes relative to the southern subtropical pole. However, there is clear evidence of the importance of the southern pole in enhancing the Australian rainfall response, when occurring in conjunction with but of opposite sign to the eastern tropical pole. The observed relationship between the meridional SST gradient in the eastern Indian Ocean and rainfall over western and southeastern Australia is also analyzed for the period 1970-2005. The observed relationship is found to be consistent with the AGCM results. © 2009 American Meteorological Society."

We show that the SST warming centered at 180°W is associated with increased monsoon precipitation over northern Australia from January to February and a decrease in December and March over the same region, leading to a shorter and more intense monsoon period. In recent years SST anomalies commonly associated with El Niño events have often exhibited a peak signature in the central, not eastern, Pacific. These so-called El Niño Modoki events are shown here to result in a markedly shorter and more intense Australian monsoon season. Copyright 2009 by the American Geophysical Union."

While individual models span different physical parameterizations and resolutions, a major component of intermodel variability results from surface wind differences. Projected changes to the surface wind field are also central in modifying future extratropical circulation and internal properties. A robust southward shift of the circumpolar current and subtropical gyres is projected, with a strong spinup of the Atlantic gyre. An associated increase in the core strength of the circumpolar circulation is evident; however, this does not translate into robust increases in Drake Passage transport. While an overarching oceanic warming is projected, the circulation-driven poleward shift of the temperature field explains much of the midlatitude warming pattern. The effect of this shift is less clear for salinity, where, instead, surface freshwater forcing dominates. Surface warming and high-latitude freshwater increases drive intensified stratification, and a shoaling and southward shift of the deep mixed layers. Despite large inter-model differences, there is also a robust weakening in bottom water formation and its northward outflow. At the same time the wind intensification invigorates the upwelling of deep water, transporting warm, salty water southward and upward, with major implications for sequestration and outgassing of CO2. A robust decrease is projected for both the sea ice concentration and the seasonal cycling of ice volume, potentially altering the salt and heat budget at high latitudes. © 2009 American Meteorological Society."

The ramifications for affected regions are dire, with acute water shortages for rural and metropolitan areas, record agricultural losses, the drying-out of two of Australia's major river systems and far-reaching ecosystem damage. Yet the drought's origins have remained elusive. For Southeast Australia, we show here that the ""Big Dry"" and other iconic 20th Century droughts, including the Federation Drought (1895-1902) and World War II drought (1937-1945), are driven by Indian Ocean variability, not Pacific Ocean conditions as traditionally assumed. Specifically, a conspicuous absence of Indian Ocean temperature conditions conducive to enhanced tropical moisture transport has deprived southeastern Australia of its normal rainfall quota. In the case of the ""Big Dry"", its unprecedented intensity is also related to recent higher temperatures. © 2009 by the American Geophysical Union."

One of the aims of this study is to investigate the link between these trends and recent changes in the large-scale atmospheric circulation in the Southern Hemisphere. The contributions from changes in Southern Hemisphere climate modes, particularly the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the southern annular mode (SAM), are quantified for the austral summer season, December-February (DJF). Increasingly drier conditions over much of New Zealand can be partially explained by the SAM and ENSO. Especially over wide parts of the North Island and western regions of the South Island, the SAM potentially contributes up to 80% and 20%-50% to the overall decline in DJF precipitation, respectively. Over the North Island, the contribution of the SAM and ENSO to precipitation trends is of the same sign. In contrast, over the southwest of the South Island the two climate modes act in the opposite sense, though the effect of the SAM seems to dominate there during austral summer. The leading modes of variability in summertime precipitation over New Zealand are linked to the large-scale atmospheric circulation. The two dominant modes, explaining 64% and 9% of the overall DJF precipitation variability respectively, can be understood as local manifestations of the large-scale climate variability associated with the SAM and ENSO. © 2009 American Meteorological Society."

During periods of enhanced East African rainfall, Indian Ocean SST anomalies reminiscent of a tropical Indian Ocean dipole (IOD) event are observed. Ensemble simulations with an atmospheric general circulation model are used to understand the relative effect of local and large-scale Indian Ocean SST anomalies on above-average East African precipitation. The importance of the various tropical and subtropical IOD SST poles, both individually and in combination, is quantified. In the simulations, enhanced East African ""short rains"" are predominantly driven by the local warm SST anomalies in the western equatorial Indian Ocean, while the eastern cold pole of the tropical IOD is of lesser importance. The changed East African rainfall distribution can be explained by a reorganization of the atmospheric circulation induced by the SST anomalies. A reduction in sea level pressure over the western half of the Indian Ocean and converging wind anomalies over East Africa lead to moisture convergence and increased convective activity over the region. The pattern of large-scale circulation changes over the tropical Indian Ocean and adjacent landmasses is consistent with an anomalous strengthening of the Walker cell. The seasonal cycle of various indices related to the SST and the atmospheric circulation in the equatorial Indian Ocean are examined to assess their potential usefulness for seasonal forecasting. © 2009 American Meteorological Society."

We focus first on the detection of the Weddell and Ross Gyre for the four seasons spanning December 2003-November 2004 within the 3-D oceanic domain south of 30° S, and show distinct seasonal differences in both the three-dimensional structure and the persistence of the gyres.

Particular focus is given to the hydrological forcing, the details of which are key to realizing simulations with stable meridional overturning circulations. The atmospheric forcing from [Large, W., Yeager, S., 2004. Diurnal to decadal global forcing for ocean and sea-ice models: the data sets and flux climatologies. NCAR Technical Note: NCAR/TN-460+STR.

We found it to be suitable for our purposes, even though its evaluation originally focussed more on the ocean than on the sea-ice. Simulations with this atmospheric forcing are presented from seven global ocean-ice models using the CORE-I design (repeating annual cycle of atmospheric forcing for 500 years). These simulations test the hypothesis that global ocean-ice models run under the same atmospheric state produce qualitatively similar simulations. The validity of this hypothesis is shown to depend on the chosen diagnostic. The CORE simulations provide feedback to the fidelity of the atmospheric forcing and model configuration, with identification of biases promoting avenues for forcing dataset and/or model development."

Two sets of AGCM integrations forced with a seasonally evolving characteristic dipole pattern in Indian Ocean SST consistent with observed ""dry year"" (PDRY) and ""wet year"" (PWET) signatures are shown to induce precipitation changes across western regions of Australia. Over Western Australia, a significant shift occurs in the winter and annual rainfall frequency with the distribution becoming skewed toward less (more) rainfall for the PDRY (PWET) SST pattern. For southwest Western Australia (SWWA), this shift primarily is due to the large-scale stable precipitation. Convective precipitation actually increases in the PDRY case over SWWA forced by local positive SST anomalies. A mechanism for the large-scale rainfall shifts is proposed, by which the SST anomalies induce a reorganization of the large-scale atmospheric circulation across the Indian Ocean basin. Thickness (1000-500 hPa) anomalies develop in the atmosphere mirroring the sign and position of the underlying SST anomalies. This leads to a weakening (strengthening) of the meridional thickness gradient and the subtropical jet during the austral winter in PDRY (PWET). The subsequent easterly offshore (westerly onshore) anomaly in the thermal wind over southern regions of Australia, along with a decrease (increase) in baroclinicity, results in the lower (higher) levels of large-scale stable precipitation. Variations in the vertical thermal structure of the atmosphere overlying the SST anomalies favor localized increased convective activity in PDRY because of differential temperature lapse rates. In contrast, enhanced widespread ascent of moist air masses associated with frontal movement in PWET accounts for a significant increase in rainfall in that ensemble set. © 2008 American Meteorological Society."

The use of such an offline methodology represents the only feasible way of simulating the long time scales required to validate the internal pathways of a high-resolution ocean model. Simulated and observed chlorofluorocarbon-11 (CFC-11) are in reasonably good agreement, demonstrating the model's skill in representing realistic ventilation. Regional passive dye and age tracer experiments aid in the identification of pathways originating from different Southern Hemisphere locations. Northern Hemisphere penetration of intermediate, mode, and thermocline waters is most extensive and rapid into the North Atlantic Ocean because these waters are involved in closing the Atlantic meridional overturning cell. However, less than 8% of this ventilation is derived from subduction within the South Atlantic in the simulation. Instead, this water enters the Atlantic just to the south of South Africa, having originally subducted primarily in the east Indian Ocean, but also in the west Indian Ocean and the west Pacific region where a pathway advects water westward to the south of Australia. This pathway also plays a large part, together with water overturned in the east Indian Ocean, in ventilating the northern reaches of the Indian basin. Northward propagation in the Pacific Ocean is limited to the low latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere and is almost exclusively accomplished by water subducted in the South Pacific. A small contribution is made from the other basins from water that spreads northward, fed by a circumpolar pathway associated with the Antarctic Circumpolar Current that forms a conduit for intermediate and mode water exchange between all three basins. Intermediate water is injected into and branches off this pathway in all basins, but most vigorously in the southeastern Pacific. © 2007 American Meteorological Society."

This study investigates the extent of ""back interaction"" whereby these oceanic SAM anomalies feed back to the atmosphere. A comparison between atmosphere-only and full coupled climate models demonstrates that air-sea interactions in the coupled system act to increase the persistence of the SAM in the atmosphere. To identify the nature of feedback from the ocean to the atmosphere, ensemble experiments are carried out in both atmosphere-only and full coupled models whereby a continuous SAM-like sea surface temperature (SST) anomaly is imposed. Both coupled and uncoupled experiments show a direct thermal response that affects the lower-tropospheric temperature and surface meridional winds. An indirect upper troposphere-wide response is also seen whose characteristics are sensitive to the coupling. For the uncoupled experiment a negative-phase SAM SST perturbation produces an indirect atmospheric response that projects strongly onto the SAM. A positive-phase anomaly, however, shows little robust response away from the local heating at the surface. The coupled experiments, however, do show linearity with respect to the sign of the anomaly. However, the response is considerably weaker than the uncoupled case and the projection of the response onto the SAM mode is poorer. Nonetheless the authors find a clear persistence of the SAM at interseasonal time scales that relies on air-sea coupling and cannot be reproduced in unforced atmosphere-only experiments. This demonstrates that the ocean plays a role in modulating the Southern Annular Mode at these time scales. © 2007 American Meteorological Society."

The model shows considerable skill in capturing the predominantly zonally symmetric SAM while regional deviations between model and observation SAM winds go a long way in explaining the generally small differences between simulated and observed SAM responses in the ocean and sea ice systems. Vacillations in the position and strength of the circumpolar winds and the ensuing variations in advection of heat and moisture result in a dynamic and thermodynamic forcing of the ocean and sea ice. Both meridional and zonal components of ocean circulation are modified through Ekman transport, which in turn leads to anomalous surface convergences and divergences that strongly affect the meridional over-turning circulation and potentially the pathways of intermediate water ventilation. A heat budget analysis demonstrates a conspiring of oceanic meridional heat advection, surface heat fluxes, and changes in mixed layer depth, which acts in phase to imprint a strong circumpolar SAM signature onto sea surface temperatures (SSTs), while other oceanic processes, including vertical advection, are shown to play only a minor role in contrast to previous suggestions. Lagged correlations show that although the SAM is mainly controlled by internal atmospheric mechanisms, the thermal inertia of the ocean reimprints the SAM signature back onto surface air temperatures (SATs) on time scales longer than the initial atmospheric signal. Sea ice variability is well explained by a combination of atmospheric and oceanic dynamic and thermodynamic forcing, and by an albedo feedback mechanism that allows ice extent anomalies to persist for many months. Nonzonally symmetric components of the SAM winds, particularly in the region surrounding the Antarctic Peninsula, have important effects for other climate variables. © 2006 American Meteorological Society."

Yet exotic species introductions remain difficult to predict and are easily misunderstood because knowledge of natural dispersal patterns, species diversity, and biogeography is often insufficient to distinguish between a broadly dispersed natural population and an exotic one. Here we compare a global molecular phylogeny of a representative marine meroplanktonic taxon, the moon-jellyfish Aurelia, with natural dispersion patterns predicted by a global biophysical ocean model. Despite assumed high dispersal ability, the phylogeny reveals many cryptic species and predominantly regional structure with one notable exception: the globally distributed Aurelia sp.1, which, molecular data suggest, may occasionally traverse the Pacific unaided. This possibility is refuted by the ocean model, which shows much more limited dispersion and patterns of distribution broadly consistent with modern biogeographic zones, thus identifying multiple introductions worldwide of this cryptogenic species. This approach also supports existing evidence that (i) the occurrence in Hawaii of Aurelia sp. 4 and other native Indo-West Pacific species with similar life histories is most likely due to anthropogenic translocation, and (ii) there may be a route for rare natural colonization of northeast North America by the European marine snail Littorina littorea, whose status as endemic or exotic is unclear. © 2005 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA."

Unlike previous Lagrangian trajectory studies, here an offline model based on a complete tracer equation that includes three-dimensional advection and mixing is employed. In doing so, the authors are able to meaningfully simulate chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) uptake and assess model skill against observation. This is the first time an eddy-permitting model has been subjected to such an assessment of interior ocean ventilation. The offline model is forced by seasonally varying prescribed velocity, temperature, and salinity fields of a state-of-the-art ocean general circulation model. A seasonally varying mixed layer parameterization is incorporated to account for the degradation of surface convection processes resulting from the temporal averaging. A series of CFC simulations are assessed against observations to investigate interdecadal-time-scale ventilation using a variety of mixed layer criteria. Simulated tracer inventories and penetration depths are in good agreement with observations, especially for thermocline, mode, and surface waters. Deep water from the Labrador Sea is well represented, forming a distinct deep western boundary current that branches at the equator, although concentrations are lower than observed. The formation of bottom water, which occurs around the Antarctic margin, is also generally too weak, although there is excellent qualitative agreement with observations in the region of the Ross and Weddell Seas. Multicentury ventilation of the outflow of North Atlantic Deep Water and bottom water from the Antarctic Margin are investigated using 1000-yr passive tracer experiments with specified interior source regions. The model captures many of the detailed pathways evident from observations, with much of the discrepancy accounted for by differences between actual and modeled topography.
