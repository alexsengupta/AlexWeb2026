## Quick Summary (100 words)

This study investigates how decadal climate models can improve rainfall predictions in Australia, particularly by using sea surface temperature anomalies (SSTAs) as predictors. The researchers developed a new statistical model that combines predictions from multiple climate models and accounts for the decreasing accuracy of these predictions over time. They found that using SSTAs from decadal experiments significantly enhances rainfall forecasts for up to three years ahead, especially in regions like Queensland, compared to traditional methods. This is crucial for sectors like agriculture and water management, as accurate rainfall predictions can inform better planning and response strategies.

## Detailed Briefing (800-1000 words)

Rainfall prediction is critically important for various sectors such as agriculture, water management, and disaster preparedness. Accurate forecasts can help mitigate the impacts of extreme weather events, particularly in regions like Australia where rainfall can be highly variable. This research article addresses the challenges associated with predicting interannual rainfall in Australia, particularly using outputs from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) decadal experiments. These experiments have made it possible to simulate and forecast climate patterns over longer timescales, but rainfall predictions have historically struggled to achieve the same level of accuracy as other climate variables.

The researchers aimed to investigate whether sea surface temperature anomaly (SSTA) indices derived from CMIP5 decadal experiments could enhance the skill of interannual rainfall forecasts for Australia. Previous studies have shown that while climate models can effectively predict SSTA, they often fail to simulate rainfall accurately due to local processes occurring over shorter timescales. This study proposes a novel approach to utilize SSTA predictions as predictors for rainfall, particularly in the context of Australia’s distinct climate zones.

The methodology involves several steps. First, the researchers derived forecasts of SSTA indices relevant to Australian rainfall from decadal hindcasts of six different climate models. They then corrected these forecasts for model drift, which is a systematic bias that can occur in climate models over time. After obtaining corrected indices, they combined them into a multimodel ensemble, which is akin to pooling various expert opinions to achieve a more reliable estimate.

The researchers developed a statistical rainfall model that uses these SSTA indices as predictors. Unlike traditional methods that employ a single statistical model across all lead times, this new approach allows the model to evolve with lead time. As the skill of SSTA forecasts typically declines with time, the model adapts accordingly, utilizing the most relevant predictors at different times. This hierarchical linear combination (HLC) model effectively merges information from both observed and predicted SSTA indices.

The key findings of this research are quite significant. The study showed that rainfall forecasts based on the multimodel ensemble of SSTA indices provided greater predictive skill compared to traditional models that relied solely on lagged observed indices. Specifically, the HLC model demonstrated enhanced skill in predicting rainfall up to three years ahead for Queensland, and one year for the Northern Monsoon Region, both of which are crucial agricultural areas in Australia. For instance, the correlation skill of the rainfall predictions was found to be higher in regions with strong relationships to SSTA, indicating a more reliable forecast.

Importantly, the study highlighted the potential of the Tropical Transbasin Variability (TBV) index in enhancing rainfall prediction skill. The TBV index, which reflects interactions between the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, exhibited a high predictability horizon of up to 36 months, significantly benefiting the rainfall forecasts. The authors noted that while the overall improvements were promising, only about 20% of the modeled regions showed significant enhancements in rainfall prediction when compared to traditional methods.

The implications of this research are substantial. Improved rainfall predictions can lead to better water resource management, more effective agricultural planning, and enhanced preparedness for extreme weather events. For instance, if these models were able to provide perfect forecasts, it is estimated that more than 70% of the regions could see significant improvements in prediction skill across all lead times. This could be transformative for sectors relying on accurate rainfall data to make informed decisions.

However, the study also indicates some limitations and areas for further exploration. The long-term predictability of rainfall is still heavily dependent on indices that exhibit high interannual predictability, such as the TBV, and the mechanisms behind these relationships are not fully understood. Future research could focus on refining the models by incorporating additional predictors or improving the representation of ocean-atmosphere interactions within climate models.

In conclusion, this research underscores the potential of using outputs from CMIP5 decadal experiments to improve interannual rainfall forecasting in Australia. By employing a more dynamic statistical approach and leveraging the strengths of various climate models, there is hope for achieving more reliable rainfall predictions. This work not only paves the way for better forecasting methodologies but also emphasizes the importance of understanding and incorporating the complex interactions between ocean temperatures and rainfall variability. The findings offer a promising avenue for enhancing climate resilience in Australia, particularly in face of the increasing variability associated with climate change.
