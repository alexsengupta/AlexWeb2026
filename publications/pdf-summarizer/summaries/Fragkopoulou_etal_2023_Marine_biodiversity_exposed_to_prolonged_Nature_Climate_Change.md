## Quick Summary (100 words)

Researchers explored how marine heatwaves (MHWs), particularly those occurring beneath the ocean's surface, affect marine biodiversity. They discovered that these subsurface heatwaves are often more intense and last longer than those at the surface, with up to 22% of the ocean's subsurface biodiversity exposed to significant thermal stress. For instance, areas like the Gulf of Mexico showed high biodiversity exposure. This matters because as global temperatures rise, these heatwaves can disrupt ecosystems, leading to shifts in species distributions and potentially devastating consequences for marine life and the communities that rely on them.

## Detailed Briefing (800-1000 words)

Marine heatwaves (MHWs) are becoming more frequent and intense due to climate change, leading to significant impacts on marine ecosystems. However, most research has focused on the ocean's surface, neglecting what happens beneath. This study addresses that gap by exploring how MHWs affect subsurface marine biodiversity, providing a comprehensive global assessment of these phenomena from the surface down to 2,000 meters deep over a period spanning from 1993 to 2019.

The researchers aimed to understand the characteristics of MHWs at various depths and how these heatwaves affect marine biodiversity. The motivation for this study is urgent, as MHWs have already caused drastic changes in marine species distributions, mass mortalities, and altered ecosystem dynamics. Traditional assessments mainly examined surface temperatures, but the authors recognized that subsurface temperatures can exhibit different patterns—warmer, longer-lasting, and potentially more damaging to marine life.

To tackle this issue, the researchers used high-resolution reanalysis temperature data, which allowed them to analyze temperature changes over time at multiple depths. They categorized MHWs based on several metrics, such as duration, intensity, and cumulative intensity, which is a measure of thermal stress over time. By combining this temperature data with information about marine species distributions, they evaluated how biodiversity is exposed to subsurface heatwaves.

The findings reveal that subsurface MHWs are often more intense than surface events, particularly between 50 and 200 meters deep. For example, the average maximum intensity of MHWs at 100 meters was measured at 1.6°C, which is significantly higher than the 1.3°C observed at the surface. Additionally, MHWs in subsurface layers can last up to twice as long as those at the surface, with the average duration increasing from about 20 days at the surface to 40 days at 2,000 meters depth. 

One alarming conclusion is that about 22% of the ocean's subsurface regions coincide with the warm edges of species distributions. This means that a significant portion of marine biodiversity is particularly vulnerable to thermal stress from MHWs. The study also identified specific regions, such as the Gulf of Mexico and the Tasman Sea, as having high biodiversity exposure across various depths. 

The significance of these findings cannot be overstated. As marine heatwaves increase in frequency and intensity due to climate change, the impacts on marine biodiversity will likely escalate. This could lead to shifts in species distributions, potentially disrupting ecological interactions and processes within marine ecosystems. For instance, warm-sensitive species, especially those at their warm range edges, may face heightened risks, leading to declines in their populations. 

The study also highlights a broader concern: as marine ecosystems experience changes, the services they provide—such as fisheries and carbon sequestration—may also be compromised. Thus, the implications extend beyond just biodiversity; they affect food security and the overall health of marine environments.

In summary, this research underscores the urgent need to monitor and understand subsurface marine environments better. The unexpected intensity and duration of subsurface MHWs reveal a complex interaction between climate change and marine biodiversity, calling for new strategies in marine conservation and management. Policymakers and stakeholders need to recognize the profound shifts occurring below the surface and take proactive steps to mitigate the impacts of climate change on marine ecosystems. As we move forward, it is clear that deeper waters are not insulated from the effects of warming, and the health of the ocean depends on addressing these challenges head-on.
