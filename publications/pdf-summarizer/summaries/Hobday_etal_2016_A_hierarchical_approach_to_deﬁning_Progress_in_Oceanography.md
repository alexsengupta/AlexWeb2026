## Quick Summary (100 words)

This research focuses on defining marine heatwaves (MHWs) to better understand their impacts on marine ecosystems, especially as climate change is expected to increase their frequency and intensity. The authors propose a clear, hierarchical definition that categorizes MHWs based on their duration, intensity, and spatial extent. For example, a marine heatwave must last at least five days with temperatures exceeding the 90th percentile of a 30-year historical baseline. This clarity is crucial for tracking ecological changes and managing fisheries, as seen in the 2011 Ningaloo Niño, which significantly affected marine life and local economies. Understanding MHWs helps in anticipating and mitigating their impacts on biodiversity and fisheries management.

## Detailed Briefing (800-1000 words)

Marine heatwaves (MHWs) are prolonged periods when sea temperatures exceed normal levels, and they are becoming more frequent and intense due to climate change. This research addresses the urgent need for a clear, standardized definition of MHWs, which is crucial for understanding their ecological impacts and for effective management in marine environments.

The authors of the study propose a hierarchical approach to defining MHWs, building on existing frameworks for atmospheric heatwaves. They suggest a general definition: an MHW is a prolonged, discrete event of anomalously warm water that can be characterized by its duration, intensity, rate of change, and spatial extent. Specifically, they define an MHW as an event lasting five days or more, with temperatures above the 90th percentile based on a 30-year historical baseline. This structured approach allows for flexibility in data usage and facilitates clearer communication about MHWs to both scientists and the general public.

To illustrate their framework, the researchers analyze three significant MHW events from the 21st century: the northern Mediterranean heatwave in 2003, the "Ningaloo Niño" in Western Australia in 2011, and the northwest Atlantic event in 2012. Each of these events had profound ecological impacts, such as the mortality of benthic invertebrates and shifts in marine species distributions, underscoring the necessity of understanding MHWs in the context of climate change.

The findings highlight that MHWs can lead to rapid changes in biodiversity and ecosystem structure, with significant socio-economic consequences for fisheries and marine industries. For example, the 2011 Ningaloo Niño caused major shifts in the local ecosystem, affecting commercially important species. Similarly, the 2012 northwest Atlantic event prompted changes in fishing practices due to shifts in species distributions.

The implications of these findings are broad. As ocean temperatures continue to rise, MHWs are expected to become more common, potentially leading to increased biodiversity loss and economic challenges for fisheries. The research outlines a pressing need for effective monitoring and forecasting of MHWs to mitigate their impacts. By defining MHWs in a standardized way, the study enhances the potential for comparative analysis across different regions and time periods, facilitating a better understanding of their drivers and impacts.

Moreover, the study emphasizes the importance of high-quality datasets for accurately measuring MHWs, as different datasets can yield varying results. The researchers advocate for the use of a robust hierarchical framework to ensure consistent definitions, which will aid in comparing events across different geographical locations and times.

In conclusion, this research underscores the critical role of standardized definitions and metrics in studying marine heatwaves. As climate change continues to alter marine environments, understanding MHWs will be essential for effective management and for safeguarding marine biodiversity and the livelihoods that depend on it. The recommendations provided by the authors could serve as a foundation for future research and policy-making aimed at addressing the challenges posed by marine heatwaves in a warming world.
