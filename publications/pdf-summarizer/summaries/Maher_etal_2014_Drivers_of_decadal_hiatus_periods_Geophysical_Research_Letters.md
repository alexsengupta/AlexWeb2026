## Quick Summary (100 words)

This study explores why global surface temperatures experience "hiatus periods," times when warming slows or pauses. Researchers found that these hiatuses can arise from volcanic eruptions, changes in ocean circulation, and human-made aerosols. For example, significant cooling occurred during the 1940-1975 period due to rising aerosol levels. Importantly, the research indicates that under high greenhouse gas emissions, hiatuses are likely to become very rare after 2030. This matters because it highlights how ongoing emissions can diminish natural variability in climate, pushing the planet towards continuous warming and exacerbating climate change impacts.

## Detailed Briefing (800-1000 words)

The research conducted by Nicola Maher and colleagues investigates the phenomenon of "hiatus periods" in global surface air temperatures (SAT), which are times when there is little to no significant warming, even amidst long-term trends of rising temperatures due to climate change. The study examines historical data, identifies the causes of these hiatuses, and discusses their likelihood in future climate scenarios. 

In the face of rising global temperatures, the existence of hiatus periods can seem puzzling. The most recent hiatus, which occurred over the past 10-15 years, raised questions about the reliability of climate models and the factors influencing temperature changes. This research addresses these questions by exploring how volcanic eruptions, natural climate variability (specifically the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation, or IPO), and anthropogenic aerosols have contributed to these hiatuses in the 20th and 21st centuries.

To understand this complex interplay, the researchers utilized simulations from a suite of climate models known as the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5). By examining these models, they categorized hiatus periods into three types: those caused by volcanic eruptions, those associated with negative IPO phases, and those affected by aerosols released by human activities in the mid-20th century. An analogy to consider is how a car may slow down (hiatus) due to external factors like a steep hill (volcanic eruptions) or a temporary change in driving style (natural variability). 

The findings were significant. The researchers found that in the absence of major volcanic eruptions, the frequency of hiatus periods is set to decrease in the coming decades, particularly under high-emission scenarios. Specifically, they projected that after 2030, the chance of experiencing a hiatus decade drops dramatically under high greenhouse gas emission pathways (known as RCP8.5), with only a slight possibility of a hiatus even if a large volcanic eruption occurs. Conversely, under a lower-emission scenario (RCP4.5), while the likelihood of a hiatus initially decreases, it may return to a 50% chance by the century's end due to stabilization in greenhouse gas concentrations.

The research highlights the role of the IPO, a natural climate pattern that can affect global temperatures over decades. The researchers found that most of the non-volcanic hiatuses were indeed connected to negative phases of the IPO, during which heat is drawn from the atmosphere into the ocean, particularly in the eastern tropical Pacific. They provided concrete examples from the historical record, showing how 62% of non-volcanic hiatuses occurred while the IPO was transitioning into a negative phase. 

A key takeaway from Maher et al.'s work is the stark contrast between past and predicted future hiatus periods. In the context of climate change, this suggests that as greenhouse gas concentrations rise, the natural variability that once allowed for hiatus periods may become increasingly overshadowed by the relentless warming trend driven by human activity. This finding is crucial for policymakers and climate scientists, as it underscores the importance of emissions scenarios in determining future climate patterns.

The implications of this research extend beyond academic discussions; they have real-world consequences. Understanding the factors that lead to hiatus periods can inform climate policy and adaptation strategies. For instance, if future climate models predict fewer hiatus periods under high-emission scenarios, it signals a need for urgent action to mitigate emissions and prevent further warming. 

Moreover, the study serves as a cautionary tale about the complexities of climate systems. It illustrates that while human actions—such as reducing aerosols—can have immediate benefits for air quality, they may inadvertently influence longer-term climate patterns. Similarly, the study warns that relying solely on historical data may not accurately predict future conditions, as the interplay between natural variability and anthropogenic influence continues to evolve.

In conclusion, Maher and her team’s research offers critical insights into the dynamics of climate hiatuses. By establishing a clear link between these periods and both natural variability and human activity, the study emphasizes the urgent need for comprehensive climate strategies that consider both short- and long-term impacts. As we move forward, understanding these patterns will be essential for navigating the challenges posed by climate change.
