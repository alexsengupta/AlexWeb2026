## Quick Summary (100 words)

This study examines changes in marine heatwaves (MHWs)—periods of unusually high sea surface temperatures—over the past century. Researchers found that from 1925 to 2016, the frequency of MHWs increased by 34%, and their duration grew by 17%, leading to a 54% rise in the total number of MHW days globally. For instance, notable heatwaves in the northeast Pacific led to significant ecological damage, including coral bleaching. Understanding these trends is crucial, as ongoing global warming is expected to exacerbate MHWs, impacting marine biodiversity and industries like fishing and tourism.

## Detailed Briefing (800-1000 words)

Marine heatwaves (MHWs) are prolonged periods of unusually high sea surface temperatures that can have catastrophic effects on marine ecosystems and associated human economies. As climate change accelerates, understanding the trends and patterns of these marine heatwaves is crucial. This research investigates how the frequency and duration of MHWs have changed over the past century, providing a comprehensive analysis of global trends using various datasets.

The study finds that from 1925 to 2016, there has been a significant increase in marine heatwaves worldwide—frequency increased by 34% and duration by 17%, leading to a 54% rise in the total number of annual MHW days. These increases are largely attributed to the rise in mean ocean temperatures driven by climate change, suggesting that with ongoing global warming, we can expect further intensification of marine heatwaves.

The researchers employed a multi-faceted approach, utilizing satellite observations, daily in situ measurements, and gridded monthly datasets to analyze marine heatwave trends. By defining MHWs based on a standardized framework—where temperatures exceed the 90th percentile of seasonal averages for at least five consecutive days—they were able to quantify changes in frequency, duration, and intensity. This method allowed for comparisons across different regions and time periods.

Key findings revealed that the global average frequency of marine heatwaves increased from approximately two events per year in 1900 to over three in recent years. Notably, the analysis highlighted that about 82% of the global ocean experienced an increase in MHW frequency, with the most significant changes observed in high-latitude regions. For example, MHW frequency rose by 2–6 annual events in the high-latitude North Atlantic Ocean. The study also identified substantial increases in MHW duration, particularly in the central tropical Pacific Ocean and northeastern Pacific Ocean, where mean durations extended by 30+ days.

The implications of these findings are profound. Marine heatwaves have been linked to severe ecological disruptions, including coral bleaching, shifts in marine species distributions, and significant economic impacts on fisheries and aquaculture. For instance, the rise in marine heatwaves has already contributed to substantial losses of kelp forests and other critical habitats, altering the structure and stability of marine ecosystems. The research emphasizes that as ocean temperatures continue to rise, the frequency and intensity of marine heatwaves are likely to increase, leading to further ecological and socioeconomic consequences.

One critical takeaway from this study is the relationship between marine heatwaves and climate variability. The researchers identified that while climate change is the primary driver of increased MHWs, natural climate variability, such as the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), also plays a significant role in modulating MHW frequency and intensity. This interplay suggests that while we can expect a general trend of increasing marine heatwaves, their occurrence may still be influenced by natural climate patterns.

The research also raises important considerations for policy and conservation efforts. As marine heatwaves become more prevalent, there is an urgent need for enhanced monitoring and predictive modeling to better understand their impacts. The study suggests that improving the spatial and temporal coverage of ocean temperature monitoring, coupled with citizen science initiatives, can aid in detecting and responding to the ecological impacts of marine heatwaves. Effective management strategies will be crucial in mitigating the adverse effects of these events on marine ecosystems and the communities that rely on them.

In conclusion, the study underscores the escalating threat posed by marine heatwaves in a warming world. As both the frequency and duration of these events increase, the ecological and socioeconomic ramifications are likely to become more pronounced. The research serves as a clarion call for urgent action in climate adaptation and marine resource management to safeguard the health of our oceans and the livelihoods of those dependent on them.
