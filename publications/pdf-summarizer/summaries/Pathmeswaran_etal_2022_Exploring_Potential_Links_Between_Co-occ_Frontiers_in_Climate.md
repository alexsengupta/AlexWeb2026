## Quick Summary (100 words)

This study investigates the relationship between coastal terrestrial and marine heatwaves in Australia, exploring whether marine heatwaves (MHWs) influence the occurrence of terrestrial heatwaves (THWs). The researchers found that THW days significantly increase when adjacent to MHWs, with effects extending at least 150 kilometers inland. For instance, near the Great Barrier Reef, the likelihood of THWs was about 82% in the presence of MHWs, indicating a strong connection. This understanding is crucial as it highlights potential compounded impacts on ecosystems and infrastructure, especially in a warming climate where both heatwave types are expected to become more frequent.

## Detailed Briefing (800-1000 words)

Heatwaves, whether on land or in the ocean, are becoming more frequent and severe due to climate change, and understanding their interactions is crucial. This research delves into the relationship between terrestrial heatwaves (THWs), which occur on land, and marine heatwaves (MHWs), which occur in the ocean, specifically in Australia. The study aims to determine whether the occurrence of MHWs influences the frequency and characteristics of co-occurring THWs, ultimately seeking to understand the implications of these intertwined phenomena.

The backdrop for this research is the increasing prevalence of heatwaves globally, which have dire consequences for public health, agriculture, infrastructure, and ecosystems. Historical events, such as the devastating European heatwave in 2003 that resulted in thousands of deaths and significant economic losses, highlight the urgent need to study these extreme temperature events. In Australia, heatwaves have caused severe impacts, including the buckling of railway tracks and damage to road infrastructure, underscoring the importance of understanding their drivers and interactions.

The researchers employed a comprehensive approach, analyzing observation and reanalysis data from 1982 to 2018. They utilized high-resolution sea surface temperature data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and atmospheric reanalysis data from the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts. The analysis focused on identifying co-occurring THWs and MHWs along Australia’s coastal belt, assessing their frequency, severity, and duration.

Through their analysis, the researchers uncovered several key findings. Firstly, they found a significant increase in the number of THW days in the presence of adjacent MHWs. Specifically, they discovered that this increase persisted at least 150 kilometers inland from the coast, indicating that the influence of MHWs extends beyond the immediate coastal area. This suggests that large-scale atmospheric conditions, rather than just local factors, play a significant role in shaping both terrestrial and marine heatwaves.

The study further revealed that the synoptic conditions leading to THWs often coincide with those that facilitate ocean warming, thereby increasing the likelihood of MHWs occurring simultaneously. The researchers identified common drivers, such as high-pressure systems that create favorable conditions for both types of heatwaves. They also documented significant trends in the frequency of THWs and MHWs over the study period, with many coastal regions experiencing an increase of approximately three additional THWs per decade by 2018 compared to 1982.

The implications of these findings are profound. If MHWs indeed amplify THWs, the ecological and socio-economic consequences could be severe. For instance, the co-occurrence of these heatwaves can lead to heightened heat stress in coastal areas, affecting marine and terrestrial ecosystems alike. Previous incidents, such as the 2010/11 Ningaloo Niña event, demonstrated the cascading effects of co-occurring heatwaves, which resulted in significant mortality among various marine species and alterations in species distributions.

Moreover, as climate change continues to drive the warming of both land and ocean temperatures, the frequency of co-occurring heatwaves may increase. This trend could lead to more frequent and intense events, resulting in greater risks to public health and economic stability. The researchers stress the importance of recognizing these interactions when developing climate adaptation strategies and policies aimed at mitigating the impacts of extreme temperature events.

One of the broader takeaways from this study is the necessity for a holistic approach to understanding heatwaves. The intertwined nature of terrestrial and marine heatwaves illustrates how changes in one environment can have cascading effects on another. This interconnectedness underscores the need for climate models and policies that take into account the combined effects of atmospheric and oceanic warming on ecosystems and human communities.

As the study concludes, it emphasizes the need for further research to quantify the processes that contribute to THWs and MHWs, including investigations into ocean preconditioning and the role of atmospheric dynamics. Understanding these complex interactions will be crucial for predicting future climate extremes and developing effective responses to protect vulnerable ecosystems and communities.

In summary, the research highlights the significant link between co-occurring terrestrial and marine heatwaves in Australia, revealing that MHWs can enhance the frequency and intensity of THWs. As climate change intensifies, the potential for these events to occur together, with compounding effects on ecosystems and human activities, makes it imperative to study and address their interactions comprehensively. Such insights are essential for informing climate adaptation strategies and mitigating the impacts of increasingly frequent heat extremes on society and the environment.
