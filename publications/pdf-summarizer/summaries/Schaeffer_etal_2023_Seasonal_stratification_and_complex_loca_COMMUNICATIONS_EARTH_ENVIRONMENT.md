## Quick Summary (100 words)

This study investigates the structure of marine heatwaves (MHWs) beneath the surface in Eastern Australian coastal waters, focusing on how seasonal stratification and local dynamics influence their occurrence. Researchers analyzed a 28-year record of ocean temperatures off Sydney and identified three types of MHWs: shallow, extended, and sub-surface. For example, sub-surface MHWs, which don't affect surface temperatures, can still cause significant ecological damage. Understanding these depths is crucial because marine heatwaves increasingly threaten marine ecosystems and industries like fisheries and tourism, highlighting the need for better monitoring of underwater temperature changes.

## Detailed Briefing (800-1000 words)

Marine heatwaves (MHWs) are extreme events characterized by abnormally high seawater temperatures that can significantly impact marine ecosystems. The frequency, duration, and intensity of these events have risen sharply in recent decades, primarily due to long-term ocean warming. This trend raises crucial questions about how these heatwaves affect marine life, especially considering that much of the research has focused on surface temperatures rather than the often overlooked subsurface layers of the ocean. The researchers in this study sought to fill this gap by examining the vertical structure of MHWs off the coast of Sydney, Australia, using an extensive 28-year record of daily subsurface ocean temperatures.

The impetus for this research stems from a growing recognition that the ecological damage caused by marine heatwaves may not only be evident at the ocean's surface. Understanding the depth structure of these heatwaves can provide insights into their overall impact on marine ecosystems, including fish populations and coral reefs that may not be directly affected by surface temperature changes. The study aims to explore how various factors, such as seasonal stratification, large-scale ocean circulation, and local downwelling processes, influence the coherence of marine heatwaves at different depths.

The researchers approached this issue by leveraging a unique dataset collected from a mooring site off Sydney, which provides daily temperature measurements at various depths from the surface down to 53 meters. By analyzing this long-term dataset alongside satellite observations of sea surface temperatures (SST) and local ocean currents, they developed a categorization system for MHWs based on their vertical structure. They identified three types of MHWs: shallow MHWs (confined to the surface layer), extended MHWs (spanning deeper into the water column), and subsurface MHWs (occurring below the surface without a corresponding surface signature). Each category reflects different underlying processes and has distinct ecological implications.

One of the key findings of this research is the significant variation in the occurrence and characteristics of these different types of marine heatwaves. Over the 28 years of data, the researchers identified 17 shallow events, 19 extended events, and 16 subsurface events. Shallow heatwaves occurred most frequently during the summer months and were typically associated with positive air-sea heat flux anomalies. In contrast, subsurface heatwaves were often linked to intensified downwelling-favorable winds, which can decouple surface temperatures from deeper layers. Extended MHWs, meanwhile, were found to be the longest-lasting events, often driven by large-scale ocean currents like the East Australian Current, which transports warm water southward.

These findings have important real-world implications. For instance, the impact of marine heatwaves can extend beyond immediate temperature anomalies; they can disrupt entire ecosystems and affect fisheries that are critical to local economies. The researchers emphasized that monitoring subsurface temperatures is essential for accurately assessing the potential damage caused by marine heatwaves, particularly in coastal regions where most biological activity occurs. Furthermore, understanding the dynamics of these heatwaves can better inform management strategies for marine resources and help predict future climate impacts.

A particularly noteworthy insight from the research is that the coherence between surface and subsurface MHWs varies significantly with seasonal stratification. During weakly stratified months, surface temperatures can serve as a relatively good proxy for subsurface conditions, with up to 57% of surface MHW days corresponding with subsurface anomalies. However, in strongly stratified months, this coherence drops dramatically, indicating that surface observations alone may not capture critical subsurface events. This underscores the need for sustained subsurface observations to understand the full extent of marine heatwave impacts.

The study closes with broader takeaways that emphasize the complexity of marine heatwaves and their potential to impact marine ecosystems in unexpected ways. The researchers caution that while satellite-derived data has revolutionized our understanding of surface temperature extremes, it cannot replace the need for in situ measurements to monitor subsurface conditions. The findings also highlight the importance of local wind patterns and ocean currents in driving both the occurrence and intensity of marine heatwaves, suggesting that climate models need to incorporate these dynamics for accurate predictions.

In conclusion, this research sheds light on the intricate dynamics of marine heatwaves and their vertical structure, revealing that the ecological impacts are more complex than surface temperature anomalies alone would suggest. As marine heatwaves are projected to become more frequent and severe with climate change, understanding their subsurface characteristics will be crucial for protecting marine ecosystems and the livelihoods that depend on them. This study advocates for integrated monitoring strategies that account for both surface and subsurface temperatures, providing a more comprehensive view of the challenges posed by marine heatwaves as we navigate an increasingly warming world.
