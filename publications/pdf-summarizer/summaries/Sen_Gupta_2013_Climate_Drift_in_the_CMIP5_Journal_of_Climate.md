## Quick Summary (100 words)

This study investigates "model drift" in climate models, which refers to long-term changes in model outputs that aren't due to actual climate shifts. Researchers found that while the latest CMIP5 models show a significant reduction in drift compared to earlier versions, it still affects certain metrics like ocean temperatures and sea levels. For instance, in some models, drift accounted for over 60% of sea level trends. Understanding and correcting for this drift is crucial because it can obscure the true signals of climate change, impacting the accuracy of climate projections and our responses to global warming.

## Detailed Briefing (800-1000 words)

Climate models are critical tools for understanding how human activities and natural processes affect our planet's climate. However, one significant issue that researchers face is "model drift." This refers to long-term changes in climate model outputs that do not stem from real climate changes but instead arise from internal model mechanics. This article, authored by Alexander Sengupta and colleagues, dives deep into this phenomenon, particularly focusing on how it manifests in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) models.

**Background/Context**

Model drift is problematic because it can obscure the true signals of climate change that researchers aim to study. In essence, it can mask the effects of external factors like greenhouse gas emissions. The research highlighted in this paper is motivated by the need to improve the accuracy of climate projections, especially as global temperatures rise and extreme weather events become more frequent. Notably, understanding and correcting for drift is crucial for policymakers and scientists who rely on these models to inform climate action and adaptation strategies.

**Main Research/Argument**

The researchers systematically assessed the extent and impact of drift across various physical and biogeochemical properties in the CMIP5 models, comparing them to the previous CMIP3 models. To do so, they employed several methodologies to estimate drift. One method involved analyzing linear trends over a 150-year period, while others utilized quadratic and cubic polynomial fits to model outputs over the available control time series.

Imagine trying to determine how a car's engine responds to different types of fuel. If the engine is poorly calibrated, it might misrepresent the effects of fuel quality, similar to how model drift can misrepresent climate responses. Researchers wanted to distinguish between genuine climate trends and drift, to ensure that the climate signals they observed were valid and reliable.

**Key Findings**

The findings revealed a notable reduction in drift magnitude from CMIP3 to CMIP5. Specifically, the multimodel mean of globally averaged sea surface temperature (SST) drift decreased from 0.06 °C per century in CMIP3 to 0.028 °C per century in CMIP5. Additionally, the drift was found to be statistically significant in 15 out of 22 models, although for most models, the drift was relatively small compared to historical trends.

Importantly, for metrics involving the deep ocean, like steric sea level (which accounts for changes in sea level due to water expansion), drift could dominate the forced changes, necessitating correction. For instance, drift accounted for more than 60% of the historical trend in some models. The research also highlighted that atmospheric drift is often influenced by underlying oceanic changes, suggesting interconnected dynamics between the ocean and atmosphere.

**Significance & Real-World Implications**

Understanding and correcting for model drift has significant implications for climate science and policy. Accurate climate modeling is essential for predicting future climate scenarios and implementing effective environmental policies. If researchers underestimate the role of drift, they risk making faulty projections about climate impacts, which can lead to inadequate responses to climate change.

For instance, if models fail to account for drift when projecting sea level rise, coastal communities may be unprepared for the actual risks they face. Similarly, understanding changes in precipitation patterns can affect water resource management and agriculture, impacting food security.

**Broader Takeaways**

The research presents several critical lessons. Firstly, it emphasizes that human actions can have unforeseen consequences on climate models, which may misrepresent the climate's response to various factors. For example, while cleaner emissions may reduce air pollution, they might simultaneously alter climate dynamics in ways that are not yet fully understood.

Moreover, the study indicates that drift correction methods must be chosen carefully, as different methods can yield significantly different results. This variability underscores the need for robust methodologies in climate modeling and analysis.

Finally, the research serves as a reminder of the complexities of climate systems and the need for continuous improvement in modeling techniques. As climate models evolve, ensuring that they accurately reflect real-world phenomena is crucial for effective climate action.

In conclusion, Sengupta and colleagues' work on climate drift in CMIP5 models highlights an essential challenge in climate science. By addressing model drift, researchers can enhance the accuracy of climate projections, ultimately aiding in the global response to climate change and its myriad impacts on ecosystems, economies, and communities worldwide.
