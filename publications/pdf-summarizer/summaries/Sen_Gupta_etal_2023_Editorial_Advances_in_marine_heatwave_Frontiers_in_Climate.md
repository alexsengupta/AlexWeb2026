## Quick Summary (100 words)

This article focuses on marine heatwaves (MHWs) and their growing impact due to climate change. Researchers found that MHWs can cause severe ecological and economic damage, such as the collapse of fish populations and ecosystems, which can lead to losses of tens of millions of dollars. For instance, the 2014-2016 "Blob" event in the Pacific contributed to the decline of kelp forests and affected fisheries. Understanding and predicting MHWs is crucial for effective marine management and mitigating their negative effects, especially as ocean temperatures continue to rise.

## Detailed Briefing (800-1000 words)

Marine heatwaves (MHWs) are becoming an increasingly significant concern as climate change accelerates. These phenomena, where ocean temperatures spike dramatically above average, can cause severe damage to marine ecosystems and the industries that depend on them. In fact, MHWs have been linked to economic losses amounting to tens of millions of dollars for various regions. This editorial discusses the latest advancements in understanding MHWs, including their drivers, impacts, and predictability, showcasing the urgent need to address this growing issue.

The researchers delve into the various factors driving MHWs, emphasizing that understanding these drivers is critical for predicting when and where these heatwaves will occur. The article highlights the use of an upper ocean heat budget as a tool for assessing heat flow in MHW regions. This method quantifies how heat enters and exits these areas due to air-sea exchanges, ocean currents, and mixing processes. However, constructing a heat budget isn’t straightforward; errors in estimating mixed layer depth (MLD) can lead to misattributions of MHW drivers. For instance, underestimating MLD can inflate the perceived impact of air-sea fluxes on MHWs.

Two studies referenced in the article offer contrasting insights into MHW drivers using heat budget approaches. One study focusing on extreme MHWs found that ocean heat advection was the primary driver of MHW growth, while atmospheric and oceanic processes contributed more evenly to their decay. The second study, however, indicated that atmospheric processes, particularly reduced evaporative cooling and increased sunlight, were more influential in the growth of MHWs at mid-to-high latitudes, while vertical mixing played a more significant role in tropical regions.

The impacts of MHWs are particularly acute near coastlines, where rich marine life supports vital fisheries. For example, a 2016 MHW off the coast of Patagonia was exacerbated by weak winds that prevented heat loss, leading to record-breaking temperatures. Similarly, research from New Zealand suggested that MHWs in enclosed coastal areas might not be directly comparable to open ocean events, indicating that local conditions must be considered in assessments.

Most research has focused on sea surface temperatures (SSTs), but there’s a growing interest in subsurface MHWs, which can have even more profound effects on marine ecosystems. A study along the Northeast US coast showed that subsurface MHWs could reach temperatures as high as 7°C, compared to the more typical 3°C observed at the surface. Another analysis from New Zealand revealed that regional ocean circulation patterns significantly influence heat content extremes, underscoring the need for localized models for accurate predictions.

The ability to predict MHWs is becoming increasingly vital for effective marine management. With the risk of more frequent and intense MHWs as global temperatures rise, researchers are working on various forecasting techniques, including numerical models, statistical approaches, and machine learning. For instance, one study identified regions in the tropical eastern Pacific where MHW onset and decline rates could be predicted with high accuracy up to four months in advance. Meanwhile, machine learning frameworks demonstrated promising skills in predicting SST anomalies for up to 18 months, although performance varied significantly across different regions.

The editorial also highlights the rising concern over compound events—when multiple extreme conditions occur simultaneously, compounding their impacts. One study found that MHWs could increase the likelihood of terrestrial heatwaves in Australia, suggesting a complex interplay between land and sea temperatures. Another case study noted how a MHW in the Bay of Bengal intensified a tropical cyclone, demonstrating the interconnectedness of these extreme weather events.

The significance of understanding MHWs extends beyond the immediate ecological impacts; they can have far-reaching implications for human activities and economies. For example, the so-called "Blob" event between 2014 and 2016 resulted in the collapse of Bull Kelp Forests in Northern California, severely affecting the local red abalone fishery. This led to a misperception among fishers of thriving populations due to the abalone’s migration in search of food, ultimately complicating management efforts. Similarly, the Ningaloo Nino in 2010-11 led to drastically reduced spawning stocks for scallops, prompting fisheries closures to facilitate recovery.

Research shows that species responses to MHWs vary significantly based on their ecological characteristics and the timing of spawning. One study found that scallops in different latitudes recover at different rates due to their spawning timings’ overlap with warmer temperatures. This insight emphasizes the need for adaptive management strategies that consider local ecological conditions.

In conclusion, the research underscores the urgent need to advance our understanding of MHWs and their drivers. As climate change continues to alter oceanic conditions, the potential for more frequent and intense MHWs will pose new challenges for marine ecosystems and human industries reliant on them. The findings call for interdisciplinary collaboration to develop effective management strategies, ensuring that we can adapt to and mitigate the impacts of these extreme marine events. With new data and analytical tools emerging, the next decade promises to yield further insights into the complex dynamics of marine heatwaves, helping to safeguard both our oceans and the communities that depend on them.
