## Quick Summary (100 words)

This study investigates how marine heatwaves (MHWs) are impacting crucial coastal species like macroalgae, seagrass, and corals across 85 marine ecoregions. The key finding reveals a significant increase in negative effects on these foundation species over time, particularly at their warm range edges. For instance, severe bleaching in corals was noted in regions like South India, where 69% of corals were affected. This research is vital as these species support biodiversity and ecosystem services, meaning their decline could disrupt fishing, tourism, and coastal protection, ultimately affecting human livelihoods and ecological health worldwide.

## Detailed Briefing (800-1000 words)

Marine heatwaves (MHWs) are becoming a pressing concern as they increasingly affect coastal ecosystems across the globe. This research article addresses the significant problem of how these intense and prolonged periods of elevated ocean temperatures impact foundation species—critical organisms that form the backbone of marine ecosystems, such as macroalgae, seagrass, and corals. With the backdrop of climate change and the rising frequency of ocean heatwaves, the study examines the responses of these vital species in 1,322 shallow coastal areas across 85 marine ecoregions.

The researchers set out to determine the extent and nature of the damage inflicted by MHWs on these foundation species. They utilized a combination of extensive ecological observations and an established framework for defining and categorizing MHWs. This approach allowed them to analyze data from various locations over time, providing a comprehensive overview of the impacts of MHWs on marine ecosystems. The researchers focused specifically on strong or extreme MHWs that are more likely to elicit detrimental responses from these species.

The key findings from the study indicate a clear and concerning trend: MHWs have been responsible for significant declines in foundation species globally. Over time, the proportion of negative responses—such as reduced growth, reproductive failure, or mass mortality—has increased, particularly in regions where species are already at the warm edges of their geographic ranges. For instance, in the Western Mediterranean, a single MHW event resulted in an average mortality of 44% among Gorgonian soft corals, while hard corals in South India and Sri Lanka experienced bleaching rates of up to 69%. By contrast, some regions, like New Caledonia, showed resilience, with bleaching rates below 1%. This suggests that certain ecoregions may possess characteristics that enhance their ability to withstand MHWs.

The implications of these findings are profound. The loss of foundation species can lead to cascading effects throughout marine ecosystems, diminishing biodiversity and altering ecological functions. For example, the decline of seagrass and kelp forests can negatively impact fisheries and tourism, which are vital to many coastal economies. The study highlights that, as MHWs become more frequent and severe, many ecosystems are at risk of losing their foundational species, which could ultimately result in ecosystem collapse. 

A significant takeaway from this research is the alarming realization that populations of foundation species, particularly those at their warm range edges, exhibit heightened vulnerability to MHWs. This raises important questions about the future of these species in the face of ongoing climate change. While some species may expand into cooler areas, the transition to new ecosystems is not instantaneous and may take decades or longer to establish. In the meantime, the socio-economic ramifications of losing these critical species could be dire, affecting everything from fishing yields to coastal protection against storms.

The research also underscores the urgent need for effective management strategies to mitigate the impacts of MHWs. By identifying regions that exhibit resilience to warming and understanding the factors that contribute to this resilience, policymakers can develop targeted conservation efforts. Such measures may include establishing marine protected areas or implementing adaptive management practices that consider the specific vulnerabilities of foundation species.

In conclusion, this study serves as a wake-up call regarding the impacts of marine heatwaves on coastal foundation species. As these events become more frequent and intense due to climate change, the consequences for marine biodiversity, ecosystem health, and human livelihoods could be severe. The research offers critical insights that can aid in predicting future impacts and in shaping effective management strategies to protect these vital ecosystems. It is clear that without immediate action, the future of many coastal environments hangs in the balance.
