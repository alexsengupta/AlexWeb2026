## Quick Summary (100 words)

This article explores the challenges of defining marine heatwaves (MHWs) based on different temperature baselines, which are essential for understanding their impacts on marine ecosystems. The authors emphasize that the choice of baseline—whether fixed, shifting, or detrended—can significantly alter perceptions of risk and trends. For instance, using a fixed baseline may suggest increasing risk as ocean temperatures rise, while a shifting baseline accounts for long-term warming, potentially indicating lower risks. This distinction matters because it influences management strategies for fisheries and conservation efforts, particularly as marine species adapt to changing conditions.

## Detailed Briefing (800-1000 words)

Marine heatwaves (MHWs) are periods of unusually high ocean temperatures that can have devastating effects on marine ecosystems, fisheries, and coastal communities. This research addresses a critical issue: how the choice of baseline temperature—used to define and analyze MHWs—affects our understanding of their impact and prevalence. With climate change leading to higher average ocean temperatures, accurately defining these baselines is essential for effective management and communication about marine heatwaves.

The researchers examined five different approaches to establishing baselines for MHW analysis, which can significantly influence reported trends and implications for marine species and ecosystems. For instance, they explored fixed baselines, where a constant reference period is used, versus shifting baselines that adjust over time to account for climate warming. They also considered detrended baselines, where long-term warming trends are removed, and adaptation-adjusted baselines, which account for species' potential to adapt to changing conditions. Each method has its strengths and weaknesses, often leading to different conclusions about the risks and characteristics of marine heatwaves.

One of the key findings from the research is that the choice of baseline can significantly alter the perceived frequency and intensity of MHWs. For example, using a fixed baseline could indicate a rapid increase in marine heatwave occurrences, which may not accurately reflect the long-term trends caused by climate change. In contrast, shifting or detrended baselines could suggest more moderate changes, depending on how they account for historical temperature variability. The researchers highlighted that nearly 96 out of 100 studies on MHWs have traditionally relied on fixed baselines, potentially skewing our understanding of the ongoing impacts of climate change on marine ecosystems.

The implications of these findings are profound. As ocean temperatures rise due to climate change, the risk of marine heatwaves is likely to increase, affecting everything from biodiversity to fisheries management. For example, in 2022, the closure of the snow crab fishery in the Barents Sea was a direct result of marine heatwaves, leading to economic losses of approximately $150 million. Understanding how baselines influence the identification of these events can help inform better management strategies, ensuring that both marine organisms and human systems can adapt more effectively to changing ocean conditions.

Moreover, the research emphasizes the need for clear communication regarding the methodologies used in MHW studies. Stakeholders, including policymakers and the public, rely on accurate information to make decisions about resource management and climate adaptation strategies. If different studies report varying trends due to the baseline methods they use, it can lead to confusion or misinterpretation of the risks associated with marine heatwaves.

One of the broader takeaways from this research is the recognition that the impacts of climate change are complex and multifaceted. For instance, while a fixed baseline might indicate increasing risks associated with MHWs, a shifting baseline could highlight the adaptability of certain marine species. This duality underscores the importance of not only selecting the right baseline for analysis but also understanding how different baselines can lead to different narratives about our changing oceans.

In conclusion, the research demonstrates that the choice of baseline for defining marine heatwaves is not merely a technical detail but a fundamental aspect that shapes our understanding of climate impacts on marine ecosystems. Moving forward, it is crucial for researchers to specify their chosen baseline approaches and the implications of those choices in their findings. This clarity will enhance the reliability of information available to decision-makers and help facilitate better planning and adaptation in the face of ongoing climate change.
