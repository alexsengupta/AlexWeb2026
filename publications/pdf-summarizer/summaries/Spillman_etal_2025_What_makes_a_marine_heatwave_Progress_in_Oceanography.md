## Quick Summary (100 words)

This article explores how to make marine heatwave forecasts more effective for various stakeholders, such as fishers and marine managers. It identifies three key elements: the forecast must be useful (accurate and relevant), useable (easy to understand and access), and actually used (effectively communicated to end users). For example, during intense marine heatwaves impacting the Great Barrier Reef, timely temperature forecasts have helped managers make proactive decisions to protect coral. This research is crucial as climate change increases marine heatwave frequency, affecting ecosystems and economies, and highlights the need for actionable information to support sustainable marine practices.

## Detailed Briefing (800-1000 words)

Marine heatwaves (MHWs) are periods of unusually high ocean temperatures that have become increasingly common as global temperatures rise due to climate change. These events can devastate marine ecosystems, leading to fish kills, coral bleaching, and disruptions to fisheries that can cause food insecurity. For example, between 2016 and 2024, the Great Barrier Reef experienced five mass bleaching events linked to MHW conditions, highlighting the urgent need for effective forecasting tools to help marine users prepare for and mitigate these impacts.

Researchers have recognized that traditional forecasting methods, which focus on historical data, are becoming less reliable in the face of changing climate conditions. This paper aims to address the challenge of making marine heatwave forecasts useful, usable, and used (the "U3" concept) by developing new forecasting models that can provide timely, actionable information to marine stakeholders.

To approach this problem, the researchers developed a framework emphasizing three critical aspects of effective forecasting: usefulness, usability, and actual use. The models must be useful, meaning they need to address specific marine heatwave-related problems with appropriate resolution and skill. They must also be usable, meaning they should be interpretable and delivered in a practical format for decision-makers. Finally, the forecast information must be actively used by stakeholders, which requires clear communication, effective engagement, and considerations of user agility and incentives.

The findings of the research highlight several key insights into how to improve marine heatwave forecasting. Firstly, the forecasts are most effective when they incorporate different timeframes, ranging from short-term (days) to longer-term (months and years). For instance, short-term forecasts can help fishers manage immediate risks associated with MHWs, while longer-term forecasts can guide strategic planning in aquaculture and fisheries. The research emphasizes the importance of sub-seasonal to seasonal (S2S) forecasts, which provide a balance between immediate and longer-term planning horizons.

One concrete example of successful marine heatwave forecasting is the operational seasonal thermal stress prediction tool used for the Great Barrier Reef. Forecasts of summer ocean temperatures, which have been refined over the years through stakeholder feedback, are now used by reef managers to plan surveys and operational strategies. This collaborative approach has demonstrated that forecasts can be effectively integrated into decision-making processes, leading to improved preparedness and response to marine heatwaves.

The research outlines the significant implications of effective marine heatwave forecasting. By providing timely and actionable information, these forecasts can help marine industries—such as fisheries and aquaculture—manage risks and enhance resilience to climate change. For example, aquaculture operators can adjust harvest schedules based on forecasted conditions, while suppliers can manage their logistics in anticipation of MHW impacts. This proactive management can reduce economic losses and support sustainable practices in the marine sector.

Moreover, the researchers emphasize the need for continuous feedback between forecasters and stakeholders to improve the forecasts' usefulness and usability. Engaging stakeholders in the forecasting process fosters trust and ensures that the information provided is relevant and actionable. Regular communication, educational campaigns, and user-friendly interfaces can enhance the capacity of users to understand and utilize forecasts effectively.

The broader takeaways from this research underscore the complex interplay between climate change, marine ecosystems, and human decision-making. It illustrates that while forecasting tools can provide critical information, their effectiveness hinges on collaboration, communication, and a deep understanding of user needs. The study also highlights the urgency of adapting forecasting systems to better address the realities of a warming ocean, suggesting that ongoing development and refinement of these models will be essential as marine heatwaves become more frequent and severe.

In conclusion, the research serves as a call to action for policymakers, researchers, and marine stakeholders to prioritize the development of robust marine heatwave forecasting systems. By fostering strong partnerships and focusing on the principles of usefulness, usability, and actual use, the marine sector can better navigate the challenges posed by climate change, ultimately transforming how we manage marine resources in an increasingly uncertain future.
