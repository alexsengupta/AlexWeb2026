### Dr Sebastian McKenna
- **Position:** PhD
- **Year:** 2025
- **Webpage:** N/A
- **First position after:** Senior climate analyst role at IAG
- **Current position:** IAG
- **Awards:** N/A
- **Research summary:** Examined the causes and impacts of sea surface temperatures in the Pacific and Indian Ocean. Analyzed surface layer heat budget to diagnose processes leading to SST biases in CMIP6 models, finding that biases in atmospheric processes (particularly surface winds) are primary causes of Indian Ocean SST biases.

### Dr Yue Li
- **Position:** PhD
- **Year:** 2019
- **Webpage:** https://au.linkedin.com/in/sophielee86
- **First position after:** Postdoc at Institute for Climate and Application Research, China
- **Current position:** Climate Scientist, NSW Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water
- **Research summary:** Investigated high-frequency ocean-atmosphere interactions over the Maritime Continent. Found that suppression of sub-daily coupling significantly affects mean SST (up to 2°C warming off Sumatra) and rainfall patterns during Asian monsoon season. Examined sensitivity of Maritime Continent rainfall and diurnal cycle to model resolution, showing increasing resolution from 3/4° to 1/4° improves mean state but 1/12° produces too-strong rainfall. Developed technique to examine cross-coastal processes associated with rainfall diurnal cycle.

### Dr Dipayan Choudhury
- **Position:** PhD
- **Year:** 2017
- **Webpage:** https://dipayanc.weebly.com
- **First position after:** Postdoc at Centre for Climate Physics, South Korea
- **Current position:** Senior Scientist (Climate and Atmospheric Science), NSW Government
- **Research summary:** Investigated rainfall prediction over Australia at interannual to decadal timescales using CMIP5 decadal experiments. Systematically compared drift correction methods for SST predictions and identified optimal approaches for different models. Showed for the first time that a Pacific-Atlantic transbasin SST index is significantly related to Australian rainfall with predictability rivaling ENSO. Developed preliminary rainfall prediction model for Australia using drift-corrected SST forecasts, demonstrating merit in adding concurrent SST values for seasonal and longer timescale predictions.

### Dr Nicola Maher
- **Position:** PhD
- **Year:** 2016
- **Webpage:** https://earthsciences.anu.edu.au/people/dr-nicola-maher
- **First position after:** Humboldt Postdoctoral Fellow, Max-Planck Institute
- **Current position:** ANU
- **Awards:** AMOS best PhD
- **Research summary:** Investigated drivers of decade-long hiatus periods in surface climate using CMIP5 models. Identified three categories of hiatus periods: volcanic eruptions, negative phases of Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation, and mid-20th century anthropogenic aerosols. Found little chance of hiatus decade beyond 2030 even with large volcanic eruption in high-emission scenarios. Showed large tropical eruptions increase likelihood of co-occurring El Niño and positive IOD events post-eruption, followed by La Niña in third summer. Used ocean model forced with observed flux trends to demonstrate Pacific trade wind intensification drives heat accumulation in both Indian and Pacific Oceans.

### Dr Xeurong Qin
- **Position:** PhD
- **Year:** 2016
- **Webpage:** N/A
- **First position after:** Guy Carpenter reinsurers
- **Current position:** Guy Carpenter & Company
- **Research summary:** Examined Pacific Equatorial Undercurrent (EUC) variability using Lagrangian trajectories. Determined optimal temporal resolution for offline Lagrangian computations (up to 9-day averaging produces statistically indistinguishable results). Identified distinct EUC source regions including low latitude western boundary currents, showing increased LLWBC transport during El Niño doesn't translate into coherent EUC changes due to eddying. Developed Lagrangian iron model showing sole NGCU iron source underestimates observations, but additional NICU source enhances iron concentrations consistent with observations and explains western iron source impacts on Eastern Equatorial Pacific blooms.

### Ritwik Misra
- **Position:** Honours
- **Year:** 2019
- **Webpage:** https://uk.linkedin.com/in/ritwik-m-510215117?trk=people-guest_people_search-card
- **First position after:** Unknown
- **Current position:** Senior Manager, Commercial Analytics at HelloFresh
- **Research summary:** Examined how marine heatwaves are projected to change in waters around Australia using 0.25° regional downscaled model. Found future simulation shows increases in both mean temperatures and temperature variability. Waters close to Tasmania characterized by largest increase in MHWs, largely due to increased variability of East Australian Current and Extension. Outside this region, changes in surface heat flux found important for temperature variance.

### Annette Stellema
- **Position:** Honours
- **Year:** 2018

- **First position after:** PhD with same supervisor
- **Current position:** CSIRO
- **Research summary:** Examined projections of the Leeuwin Current in climate models. Using 28 climate models, showed consistent projection of weakening Leeuwin Current and Undercurrent due to reduced onshore flow and downwelling related to changes in alongshore pressure gradient. In southwest Indian Ocean, found robust weakening of Madagascar currents, Agulhas Current and Mozambique Channel transport, partly associated with weaker Indonesian Throughflow and overturning circulation.

### Kate Simmonds
- **Position:** Honours

- **First position after:** PhD at University of Melbourne

Compared response of observational datasets to ENSO with reanalyses to determine best reanalysis for extremes. Applied spatial clustering algorithm (ClusterMax) to identify medoids representing temperature clusters and investigated mechanisms behind asymmetries.

### Su Nish
- **Position:** Honours
- **Year:** 2017
- **Webpage:** https://au.linkedin.com/in/nish-su
- **First position after:** Energy consultant
- **Current position:** Energy consultant
- **Research summary:** Provided detailed assessment of seasonal differences of marine heatwaves (MHWs) and marine cold spells (MCSs) in the Indian Ocean Basin. Found strongest SST anomalies in MHWs and MCSs occur during warmest seasons. Showed large-scale climate drivers modulate MHW and MCS frequency asymmetrically - more MHW days during El Niños and fewer MCS days, with opposite for La Niñas. Analysis of multi-decadal trends found intensity and frequency of MHW days have increased over time while opposite occurs for MCSs.

### Sarah Perry
- **Position:** Honours
- **Year:** 2019
- **Webpage:** N/A
- **First position after:** Policy work at Clean Energy Regulator
- **Current position:** Clean Energy Regulator
- **Research summary:** Investigated projected changes in ENSO's teleconnections over global land areas in CMIP5 models. Showed models project robust increase in areal extent of ENSO's temperature and precipitation teleconnections in high-emission scenarios, associated with changes in ENSO-driven precipitation in tropical Pacific. Found models do not agree on robust projected changes in teleconnection strength for majority of regions, partly related to internal variability. Analyzed atmosphere-only model experiments focusing on South American teleconnections, showing projected increase in ENSO-driven tropical Pacific precipitation results in changes in large-scale atmospheric circulation.
