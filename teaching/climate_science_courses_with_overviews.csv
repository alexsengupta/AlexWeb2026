Course Code,Level,Requirement Type,Advanced Science (CLIMB1),Major (CLIME1),Course Name,Overview
CHEM1031,1,Core,Yes,Yes,"Higher Chemistry 1A: Atoms, Molecules and Energy","This course builds on an elementary knowledge of chemistry (equivalent to two years of high school chemistry, such as Year 12 chemistry, or CHEM1001 at UNSW) to explore the quantum mechanical structure of atoms leading to an understanding of the periodic trends in the properties of the elements. This knowledge is applied to understanding chemical bonding and intermolecular forces which together are responsible for determining the properties of materials. General principles of chemical equilibrium are developed and applied to chemical reactions involving acids and bases. The applications of the laws of Thermodynamics to chemical processes are described and ultimately linked to chemical equilibrium. The course involves an overview of chemical reactions involving electron transfer, including their applications in biology, corrosion and energy storage for portable electronic devices. The theoretical content of the course is delivered through a combination of online lessons, workshops and lectures with problem solving skills developed in weekly group-based tutorial classes. Theory is combined with the practical aspects of chemistry in weekly laboratory classes. This course covers the same material as CHEM1011, but has differentiated laboratory and tutorial classes to allow for more indepth exploration of the material in small group contexts. Note : Assumed knowledge equivalent to year 12 chemistry or CHEM1001. Students cannot subsequently enrol in CHEM1001 after completing CHEM1031. However, students may complete CHEM1001 followed by CHEM1031."
CHEM1001,1,Core,Yes,Yes,"Chemistry 1A: Atoms, Molecules and Energy","This course is designed for students entering university with little or no background in Chemistry. It is an ideal preparatory course for those who need to complete first-year chemistry as part of their degree or major but lack the assumed knowledge for CHEM1A. It is also a valuable and engaging elective for students who wish to become chemically literate—and navigate our chemical world. Important Notes: Enrollment in CHEM1001 is not recommended for students who have already achieved a satisfactory performance in HSC Chemistry (or equivalent). However, if you attempted HSC Chemistry in Year 11 but do not feel confident in your chemistry skills, CHEM1001 is a suitable choice. CHEM1001 is an elective only, it does not fulfill the chemistry requirement in any program or major. Students intending to progress to Level II Chemistry must complete CHEM1011/CHEM1021 or CHEM1031/1041 sequentially, or CHEM1811/1821 for engineering students. Students who must complete CHEM1811, 1051 or 1832 as part of their program but wish to take CHEM1001 in T1 will need to complete CHEM1011 in T2 instead of these courses - you should contact the Nucleus for advice and to gain permission from your program authority. Completing CHEM1001 allows you to count this course as a Level 1 course towards the total units of credit (UoC) required for the Science component of your degree If you enrolled in a single program outside the Faculty of Science this course can count as a general elective. Course Structure: The theoretical content of CHEM1001 is delivered through a blend of online lessons, workshops, and laboratory sessions. Students can expect approximately 5 contact hours per week. The course assessment structure is competency based and the course utilities the competency grading model."
MATH1131,1,Core,Yes,Yes,Mathematics 1A,"This course builds on high school calculus-based courses to provide a solid foundation for further study in mathematics for students in STEM disciplines. It is taken by undergraduate students typically in their first year and is usually followed by MATH1231 or MATH1241.

It shows how theorems such as the Maximum-Minimum Theorem, the Intermediate Value Theorem and Mean Value Theorems are used to justify properties of common functions and to solve both theoretical and applied problems. The Algebra half of the course introduces vectors and matrices and the solution of systems of linear equations by Gaussian elimination which paves the way for linear algebra in later courses. Technology is used throughout the course through use of the Maple computer algebra system and students producing a typeset assignment. Students are assumed to have a good understanding of NSW HSC Mathematics Extension 1 and 2 subjects.

CLIM1001,1,Core,No,Yes,Introduction to Climate Change,"Why do people disagree so much about climate change? How can they tell fact from fiction in the debate? How do they know climate change is happening and what are the causes? Climate change is now an issue confronting many disciplines, from architecture, engineering and business through to environmental science, public health, law and economics. This online course will draw on a broad collection of UNSW experts to cover the basics of climate change science, as well as a selection of key related areas from psychology, law, politics, economics, energy supply, ethics and health. A range of perspectives on the nature of these challenges will be treated with a critical analysis approach, as well as hands-on engagement with the peer review process, highlighting its role in the scientific process. This course is an online-only offering and therefore there are no physical attendance requirements. There are no pre-requisites and so this course suits students at any stage of their degree. Lectures are asynchronous. However, the course requires regular and consistent online participation including online group work with other students. Students are expected to familiarise themselves with the course documentation and spend around 6 hours per week on the course. This includes going through lesson content in a timely manner, participating in group work activities, contributing to online discussion forums, and submitting assessments. Take a look at our short introduction video"
CLIM2001,2,Core,Yes,Yes,Fundamentals of Atmospheric Science,"This course covers the basic physical principles and processes which govern our atmosphere and its climate. Firstly, students are provided with an overview of our the Earth’s atmosphere, the main physical principles that govern its behaviour, and how to apply them to important questions about weather and climate. This overview draws on foundational theoretical and applied concepts in physics and chemistry (including calculus); shows students an important application of basic physics (and a bit of chemistry); and for Oceanography, Meteorology and Climate students, in preparation for future courses in their Programs, this provides a foundation upon which later courses will build. As part of their learning, students will be introduced to concepts including the ozone hole, the greenhouse effect, how to use charts to determine the likelihood of storms developing, why deserts occur at certain latitudes, and how to forecast the weather. Students will then have the opportunity to consider these concepts in an applied context and practise their skills through activities that integrate real-world problems and situations. This skill will add value to the work that students have already invested in learning those principles and will be relevant no matter what later path in life they take. Furthermore, both mid-term and final exams will be organised as oral exams, supporting students to learn and gain confidence in communicating within interview-style situations; an essential life skill for the rest of their careers."
CLIM2002,2,Core,Yes,Yes,Risks and Impacts of a Changing Climate,"As global temperatures near 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels and track towards 2°C, broad sectors across government, non-government and industry must consider and plan for climate change impacts.
